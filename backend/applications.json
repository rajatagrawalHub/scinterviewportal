      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community.": "At VIT, I have contributed to the community through active involvement in both technical and extracurricular domains. As a core member of the Sports FNB Club, I was responsible for managing all sports-related activities within the club, including planning, coordinating, and ensuring smooth execution during major campus events. My leadership helped streamline operations and improve team efficiency.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One commonly overlooked change that students often want is better mental health support and stress management resources, especially during high-pressure periods like exams or project deadlines. While academic and extracurricular achievements are emphasized, students frequently struggle in silence due to stigma or lack of accessible support systems.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for this by first collecting student feedback through surveys or informal discussions to highlight the need. I\u2019d then present these insights to faculty or administration along with practical solutions\u2014such as peer counseling programs, regular wellness workshops, and dedicated \u201cno-class\u201d mental wellness days."

If given the opportunity, I would advocate for the creation of a dedicated recreational area where students can unwind, socialize, and celebrate milestones without having to leave campus. I would work on gathering student feedback, proposing the idea to the council, and collaborating with the administration to ensure the space is accessible, inclusive, and well-maintained."

I would work with student councils and faculty coordinators to propose a system where important academic and extracurricular events are synchronized, ensuring students can participate fully in both without compromise."

This makes it difficult to walk between buildings, attend classes on time, and even creates safety concerns due to slippery or flooded paths. It\u2019s a regular inconvenience during the monsoon season, but rarely addressed at the infrastructure level.Realistic improvements like installing proper drainage systems in problem zones or adding covered walkways can make a big difference without massive costs."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One of the key perspective that shapes a students life is the one they have as a fresher. I have students who I speak to till date, who appreciate the communities run on Instagram for how much it helped them with realisation of information and feeling like VIT was a home away from home. \n\nSo one improvement that is often overlooked is the experience in the university for a fresher. I\u2019d advocate for it by curating special icebreakers or breakout rooms online, or maybe offline events in the Fall Semester, when the freshers have just come in, to help them feel like they belong here, which will further help them have a positive outlook at the rest of their time at Vellore. \n\nThe information dissipation during Admissions procedure is pretty weak. I feel that with stronger backing by student council now that they have 2nd years, and potentially in collaboration with the admissions office, we could help in personalised outreach and one-to-one discussions during the admissions week."

I have also coordinated with the Collectorate of Trivandrum, Kerala for the initiative of Students for Society, a venture to engage school and college students to participate in events beneficial to the society. \nThrough these experiences, I have expertise in handling events and have developed a strong quality of good leadership. The members I have worked along with were able to get along with me easily, and as a leader I never used to command them, but rather work along with them always. And as a recognition of this, I have recieved the Best NSS Volunteer Award from the University of Kerala for the academic year 2023-24. \nI believe I am a very good speaker and am able to convey the facts and messages to people in a really great way. The evidence for this could be considered by the 2 years teaching experience that I have. I am a good as well as an active listener. Also I can handle 4 languages fluently - English, Malayalam, Tamil and Hindi. This would be an added advantage of mine. \nAs a student focusing on academics and future prospects, I understand the struggles the students are facing here and I believe I would be able to address them in a well manner.",

I would like to create a medium through which each and every procedure and doubts of every students will be cleared in a fast manner instead of running around places. I believe there are a lot of students who have the incomplete picture of what to do even when they are vacating hostels. So this is the sector I would like to empower and advocate."

Many a times, quizzes are conducted by faculties in the classrooms itself which imposes a lot of problems to many students with minimal to low connectivity which adversely affects their score in the quiz. The solution to this problem could be enabling student wifi in the academic blocks or to avoid unnecessary distractions with the wifi, the faculties could be instructed to take the quizzes either in paper format or from hostel blocks itself where student wifi is accessible. Looking at a broader picture, I believe that student wifi should be enabled in the academic blocks too so that any student facing trouble understanding a topic could easily read through via the Internet."

So in order to escape from the reality of hostel food, students order from swiggy, zomato etc. The very popular issue among the students is the end time for food delivery. 7 pm is a very problematic time, as half of the vit population wouldn't have even finished their classes. So ordering of food after class amd receiving it before 7, is a big issue. I wojld propose extension of the time till 8:30 or 9, which is a more apt time to have dinner amd will also provide enough time for students to finish their classes anf order food."

I have taken part in numerous competitions specifically UI-UX designing in colleges like IIT rourkee and NIT trichy and have won first or second prize in all. Being a good student overall i help my juniors and peers overcome issues they face here on campus, whether it be helping them in skills i am proficient in or helping in academics by teaching them topics. I have also been an active member in the chapter that i am a vice chair in, mostly the work has been teaching the new members skills that we have a hold on like antenna designing and EMC topics. I feel like i could contribute more to the community if given a platform just like this and make this campus better in every way possible.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "My key skills involve a strong hold on electronics core subjects, academically and outside academics as well.

VIT is a place to learn and grow afterall and i want everyone of us to understand and utilise the opportunities this campus provides us like the lab and the open and welcoming gesture of the professors to get into research and publish papers.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "I think for domain specific engineering branches like electronics, electrical and mechanical, students are simply unaware of the opportunities they have in the job market in their domain. Our professors do their part of making everyone aware of the companies that hire through their subjects but students don't realise how big the market actually is. Making the students more aware of these opportunities is something that would help both the students and the VIT placement cell as they wont have to worry about a huge crowd trying to get into just one domain, software, regardless of the branch. More workshops and awareness is required for this and can easily be attained if it is made mandatory for the students to attend guest lectures that our professors organise at the end of the semester. Another solution i can think of is organising workshop by the students where they research and understand the needs of the market and start working in that direction.",

To bridge this gap, initiatives such as regular CP contests, workshops, and mentorship programs should be introduced. Encouraging CP will not only enhance problem-solving skills among students but also attract top-tier companies looking for such talent. These steps can significantly elevate the impact and reputation of VIT\u2019s technical ecosystem.",

Instead of merely addressing the issue of platforms, I focus on the creation of cross-channel long-form narrative-driven content as well as short-form content for bite-sized consumption that enables an effortless transition from brand awareness to conversion. I invite my audience to take an active role in shaping the content by empowering them with polls, feedback forms, and co-creation challenges that allow driven collaboration, thus encouraging community. Using micro-communities, I foster authentic relationships assigning purpose to my campaigns, aligning them with movements that make the intended interactions more meaningful.

Many students with exceptional skills and talents miss out on opportunities to participate in management activities simply because their CGPA doesn't reflect their abilities. If given the chance, I would advocate for a shift in focus towards a more holistic approach when evaluating students for roles in events and management activities. This could include assessing skills, leadership potential, and past experiences, rather than solely relying on academic scores. By doing so, we could unlock a broader pool of talent and provide more inclusive opportunities for students to showcase their capabilities.\nBeing a BBA student, I have always been fascinated by management and administration, which drives my passion for roles that involve planning, execution, and coordination of events or initiatives. I can confidently assure you that I\u2019ll bring meaningful contributions wherever I\u2019m involved, especially in environments that require attention to detail and collaboration."

Many feel that cultural events often center around performances, leaving the audience as passive spectators, which creates a disconnect.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for more interactive events, such as workshops, group activities, and competitions, where all students can get involved.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One major improvement often overlooked at VIT is fostering a stronger and healthier junior-senior relationship. While the campus is free from ragging, there's still a noticeable gap between juniors and seniors, which leaves many first-year students without proper guidance in academics, hostel life, and adjusting to campus life. Additionally, crowd management in lift lobbies and on narrow footpaths needs better planning to avoid congestion during peak hours. Lastly, there are certain smoking spots near the campus that create an unhealthy environment, and I would actively work towards shutting them down through coordination with authorities and student awareness efforts."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "Equipping the Class with Silent Participation Hours \u2013 The Future of Classrooms Inclusive of Introverts and Neurodiverse Students.\nOne radical but yet an effective change that can be used widely is a method called Silent Class Participation Hours. This strategy essentially creates special class periods in which students interact only through written, digital, or non-verbal mediums (chat forums, live polls, or anonymous sticky notes). The traditional conversation format favours students with quick and loud voices leading to introverts, non-native speakers, neurodiverse students (e.g., those suffering from social anxiety or autism) completely at the disadvantage. The new system will make decision through voting hence the participation of every opinion will be validated, not only by the loudest.\nAs the Secretary, I'd actively campaign for:\n1. Faculty Cooperation: Begin with 1-2 subjects and with openminded professors going the experimental methods way, whereby tools such as Mentimeter or Slack are applied thus promoting the real-time silent discussion.\n2.Evidence-based Appeal: Compare the course grades and the feedback of the students before and after the implementation of the new technique. This will be the best way to prove the most conducive way of inclusive learning.\n3.Informative Activities: Create \"A Day of Silence\" where every student will participate even extroverts will promote the growth of empathy.\nThis is not to say that debate should be removed from the educational system but it means the restructuring of academic spaces to be places of high regard for cognitive diversity. Just think of a class of Shakespeare, where through poetic text threads, scholars can collaborate in the unraveling of the soliloquies of Hamlet, or a lecture of physics in which students give life to the equations by drawing together. By getting the whole of the society to silently work together, we have built a society that will be capable of working flawlessly remotely and of communicating with AI as they forge careers for themselves. Let\u2019s make education accessible not just in body, but in voice all voices.\n\u00a0It\u2019s something you can physically touch and feel, it also aligns with the perception of disparity that is not visible. Candidates typically talk about additional events or the upgrade of facilities, whereas this one aims directly at the culture of learning, which indicates that you\u2019re not only a facilitator but also a visionary.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "Let's not go with the usual talent hunts. Instead, we will come up with VIT\u2019s Reverse Scouting Network where we will be inside the national-level competitions even before they begin. How? Through the use of student agents of change (in the guise of ordinary audience members) we shall be able to gather evidence about the performances of rival teams, understand judging patterns, and finally recognize niche categories where VIT can be the unanticipated winner (e.g., regional languages spoken word poetry)\nThen, we have\u00a0The Trojan Horse Strategy: We\u00a0will form hybrid teams by going into partnership with the losers at IITs, SRM, and other top-tier fests. If you put a singer from VIT and a beatboxer from BITS together, you are creating a no-loss act. We are promoting the spirit of cooperation rather than antagonism.And then comes The Viral Gambit: Don't merely perform seize the narrative!Train your teams to set up \"moment marketing\" stunts that will trend louder than the competition (pause mid-dance to call attention to a social issue, etc.). Even if trophy-less, the internet will be ours and so will next year's invitations. \nRivals brace themselves for what we did last year. We attack where they do not expect our guerrilla actions. \nSecret weapon: Rogue the VIT meme pages as cultural sleeper cells to broadcast the unconventional victories."

By launching awareness campaigns and ensuring accessible, confidential services, we can foster a culture of support, reduce stigma, and promote student well-being, ultimately creating a more inclusive and successful academic environment."

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community.": "I have been an active member of team RoverX where I worked as the Research and Development Member. Working in this team allowed me to to present the team during expos inside the campus on events like the Independence day or other special occasions. I was able to interact with students and help drive a curiosity towards space technology in them. \n\nI am currently working with team Lamda, an autonomous start-up team under the SELECT school. I am working as the Battery Management and Systems Lead in the team. We were collectively able to raise sponsors and funding for our product: 'An autonomous Solar Bot for cleaning Solar Panels', by presenting our product in national expos like the IInvenTiv 2025 at IIT Madras. Our team helped feature VIT in newspapers and also highlight VIT's Sustainable technical innovation in a National Expo, drawing the attention of many funding agencies. Our product helps VIT achieve India's Sustainable Development Goals for Energy Efficiency.\n\nI also had the opportunity to visit Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, last summer where I could work an AI ML project . This opportunity helped me develop international ties with the university and share my learnings from VIT in a Global platform.\n\nI also lead a small self help group inside the hostel, with my friends, where I mentor my peers academically and also help them in any aspect of their personal life by visiting them in their rooms and councilling them during my free time.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively.": "I believe I'm an excellent orator and leader.

During my school years I have actively participated and won laurels in various debates, public speaking competitions which helped me voice out my opinion in a positive and resonant way. \n\nI believe I can use my oratory and leadership skills to represent VIT in National and international forums. Likewise my technical skills in my area of discipline also equips me to contribute to developing VIT's research ecosystem and promoting it's interest amongst my peers.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "A lot of female students have shared their experience on how they feel discriminated among their male peers in college. Working in a technical team has also enabled me to catch a glimpse of the same. At times male students tend to dominate their roles. If I were to be a member of the student council i would advocate to see that both male and female students feel that they are given equal opportunities inside the team. For instance having a mandatory 50% female student ratio in the team would improve gender diversity and also ensuring a minimum number of female students represent the team in any international or national events. \n\nAnother major challenge is waste production inside campus. E.g. The coconut water shop inside campus, sells the coconut water in plastic bottles instead of selling it in the coconut shell itself. In this way 100s of plastic bottles are generated inside the campus. If I were a student council member I would advocate for less waste generation by making use of reusable steel glasses instead of plastic bottles, saying no to plastic bags, thereby making VIT an eco friendly campus"

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

Students from fields like design, humanities, and management don\u2019t always get the platform they deserve to showcase their work.

For the other CCs, we can monitor their engagement and decide whether to give them approval.\nI also suggest that for the winning participants (in national/international), we should give them a token of achievement like a T-shirt which says 'Achiever' on the back with VIT logo. This can market as an appreciation given by VIT to the students for their achievements."

This body would serve as the first point of contact for student concerns, aiming to address and resolve matters promptly. Faculty involvement would be reserved for more complex or sensitive issues that require their expertise. Such a structure not only empowers students to take initiative but also ensures that faculty time is utilized efficiently.\n\nImplementing this system would foster a collaborative environment where students feel heard and valued, leading to a more responsive and cohesive campus community."

Because every student aims to stand out in terms of resume, one will always join technical clubs and chapters for the same. Opportunities like national, even district level coding must be provided better to students and they should be trained for the same. Only then can we revolutionize, so to say, the chapters in VIT.",

I have also proudly represented VIT in inter-college dance competitions, contributing to the cultural vibrancy of our institution. This year, I aspire to serve as the Member Secretary (Technical), having realized the critical role of technology in enhancing campus experiences\u2014especially during events like Yantra, where everything from the website to judging was managed digitally. I aim to contribute my technical skills to streamline and improve such initiatives, working for the community in a more impactful and innovative way.",

My ability to listen to others and address concerns has helped me connect with students and resolve issues effectively. Additionally, I possess strong technical skills in software development and digital tools, which I believe can be leveraged to improve the efficiency of campus events and operations. I can contribute most effectively in roles that require a combination of technical insight and organizational leadership\u2014particularly in streamlining event workflows, managing digital platforms, and fostering better student engagement.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "Health and quality of life are crucial when living away from home, but the poor condition of hostel accommodations\u2014especially for STAR scholarship students\u2014is often overlooked. These toppers are automatically allotted overcrowded dorms with poor ventilation, just 2\u20133 fans for many students, and even rodent infestations. In one serious case, a girl was bitten by a rodent, and the warden\u2019s only advice was to keep windows closed\u2014ignoring the need for airflow in packed rooms. Though this is technically a hostel issue, due to the seriousness of the situation and the lack of action being taken, I believe it should be addressed by the Student Council. I would advocate for better living conditions, a more thoughtful room allotment process, and a prompt, student-focused response through proper channels.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "Although the current tech opportunities are excellent, they can be further enhanced by incorporating skilled training sessions and workshops that focus on practical, industry-relevant skills\u2014mirroring the exact scenarios we\u2019ll face in the industry. Increasing inter-club collaboration will also help students pool resources and knowledge, leading to more innovative projects. Hands-on events like hackathons and project-based competitions, along with mentorship programs, will ensure that students not only learn theory but also gain real-world experience, better preparing them for their future careers.",

      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "As a member of the Dance Club, I have represented VIT in inter-college competitions, where I almost made it to the final. In the final, however, the key difference was that other teams had guidance from expert trainers who could help with impromptu choreography on the spot, which made a significant impact on their performance. As an artist, I am passionate about refining my skills, and I believe that if VIT provided more access to trained professionals for our teams, it would greatly enhance our performance and success in external events. With better training, we could unlock our full potential and achieve greater recognition for the university."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "The one change or improvement that is wanted but is overlooked is the vtop rigidity. Sometimes DA's and others uploads are missed so the availability to be able to change the dates accordingly.\nAlso the workload is too much for students who are focusing on extracurricular skills especially technical who would want to grow in these areas but due to exams and workload aren't able to.\nIf given the opportunity, I would ask for the formation of a technical council to be made a part of DSW that takes care of the issues within vtop and which is student led. Also this committee should be able to evaluate and present a report of the outstanding technical skills a person has learnt to a faculty group or DSW and then accordingly be able to provide relaxation of some sort in terms of deadlines as they were focused on other things.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "As of now the people associated with Clubs and Chapters are not adding much value is my belief. Only a few people within the club have knowledge and are building applications for this , but the others are not adding much value.\nThe technical clubs need to be more organised and have regulated power in the sense that some assessments are conducted for each interaction(teaching).\nAs of now the teaching done by these clubs are good, but the propagation of knowledge is not there.\nI hope and believe to have a forum established where the technical clubs and chapters each are assigned a weekly role to teach some placement related topic, and after the week is over an assessment is conducted offline where the people who already know or want to know i.e are interested are helped to develop the skills more effectively and efficiently. This is similar to an EXC but in that, a report is asked after one year which is not as demanding to increase growth of technical skills as needed. This all would still be under non graded EXC but would be improved immensely.",

Volunteering in both events I consistently exceeded the sales targets through my strategic approach and strong communication skills. In addition to my fest involvement, I have been an active member of two clubs AdMark and Innovation and Creation club. As part of the Innovation and Creation club I played a key role in organizing and managing a full-day event for over 200 participants. With a small team of three I oversaw planning and guest coordination ensuring the successful execution of the program. These experiences have significantly enhanced my skills in leadership, teamwork, and event management.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "I possess strong skills in communication, leadership, team management, decision-making, and collaborative work. I am also highly adaptable and open to diverse perspectives which helps me work well in group settings. I believe my strength in team coordination and clear communication allows me to contribute most effectively in roles that involve planning, organizing, and working with people particularly in cultural or group-based environments where teamwork and mutual understanding are very much essential for success.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One change that many students at VIT want but is often overlooked is promotion of cultural events and performances. VIT is home to numerous talented cultural groups who practice daily and consistently deliver outstanding performances. However, despite their hard work, the final events where they showcase their talent are often not known to the larger student due to a lack of proper advertising and outreach. Many students express a genuine interest in either participating in or attending these events but miss out simply because they are unaware of when and where they are happening. If given the opportunity, I would advocate for a structured promotional strategy using social media, use extra mural hours for one to one advertisement, using charts and digital boards now seen in every educational block as well as every educational building and collaboration with all cultural club to ensure every cultural performance, whether culture specific or non-specific, reaches a wider audience. I believe it\u2019s essential that the hard work of these passionate groups is appreciated and supported by the student community who are eager to engage and celebrate their efforts.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "In my opinion VIT already provides excellent support in terms of infrastructure sound systems, props, and practice areas are not a limitation. Students here are incredibly talented and self-driven not needing a dedicated mentor or coach to guide them. However, to enhance participation and increase the chances of success in external events, I believe a more structured and focused talent categorization is essential. For example dancers could be grouped based on their specific dance forms and singers based on genres. This kind of focused grouping would allow each team to specialize, train deeply and represent VIT in multiple specific categories increasing our chances of winning across different event types. Additionally, I believe there are many highly talented individuals on campus who are not currently part of any existing group. By initiating a structured talent identification and onboarding process, we can bring in fresh talent form new teams and significantly expand VIT\u2019s representation and success at external competitions."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

So there is a gap in communication between the college administration and the students despite the college trying to explain everything over emails but due to the lack of a place to ask and get answers to the queries. I would try to bridge that gap between the administration and the students by getting to know the exact rules of procedure of various events in the college and keeping myself open for questions for the same so that the students can come to me and clarify their doubts anytime.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT already excels in everything it does when it comes to external events. To further enhance its performance, the participants can be given relaxation from their DA's, quizzes and if possible CATs either by delaying them or by some sort of compensation so that the participants can fully focus on their perfomance during the events"

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

If given the opportunity, I would advocate for inclusive cultural events where different religious and regional groups are encouraged to share their traditions with the wider student body. This would not only foster a sense of community but also help create a more accepting and united campus environment.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "One major challenge in technical clubs is the lack of proper foundational training for students before they begin working on projects.

By identifying skilled individuals across clubs and chapters and supporting them through training, coordination, and representation, we can ensure VIT is well-represented.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

Often, a single event\u2014regardless of context\u2014can overshadow a student\u2019s consistent dedication and contributions.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for a structured, transparent system that allows students to genuinely present their case and seek reinstatement or redemption when appropriate. This system would be designed with checks and balances to ensure that it upholds the values of fairness, responsibility, and integrity, without being misused.\n\nI believe that recognizing the humanity behind every student and allowing for genuine second chances would not only foster a more supportive community but also encourage resilience, accountability, and a stronger bond between the student body and the administration."

However, I have actively engaged with the ecosystem by interning at two VIT-based startups; Jurident and MossX, where I gained valuable experience and contributed to their growth. I also a technical Core member of the VIT Film Society and intend to support and contribute to major events in VIT through this role. Additionally, I was selected as a research intern for a project on Nanomaterials under Dr. Madhumita G. Although I was unable to continue due to an extended winter break for personal reasons, the opportunity reflected my drive to engage in academic and research activities within VIT.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "I believe some of my strongest traits are hard work, leadership, and the ability to inspire and encourage others. I enjoy working in teams where I can help people reach their full potential, and I try to lead with empathy. Just as an example, being a long-distance runner myself, I motivated four of my friends to start waking up early and run with me. It might not seem like a big deal, but they\u2019ve collectively run over 80 km since we started, gotten noticeably fitter, and even signed up for their first 10K race. I also encouraged my roommate to start going to the gym, and now he enjoys staying fit and eating healthy!\n\nOn the technical side, I\u2019m skilled in marketing, content creation, filmmaking, and video editing. These help me think creatively and communicate ideas effectively. I believe my strongest contributions would be in media production, event marketing, and community engagement\u2014especially in clubs, festivals, or any space that blends creativity with collaboration.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "As a dedicated and consistent lifter and athlete, one issue I\u2019ve noticed that often gets overlooked is the unfair system of gym registration for the men\u2019s hostel. The slots get filled up within a minute of opening, which makes it nearly impossible for genuinely committed students to get access. What\u2019s more frustrating is that many students sign up out of impulse, go for a few weeks, and then stop entirely\u2014while those of us who train consistently are left without access. A fair solution could be allowing students who no longer use their membership to transfer it to someone who genuinely wants it but couldn\u2019t register.\n\nAnother major concern, especially for athletes and regular gym-goers, is the lack of protein-rich options in the hostel mess. While the meals are mostly high in carbs, they often lack sufficient protein\u2014something essential for muscle recovery, growth, and overall health. If given the opportunity, I\u2019d advocate for an additional paid option in the mess, like boiled eggs, grilled chicken, or paneer, so students who need higher protein intake can subscribe to it separately. It\u2019s a small change that would make a big difference for the health and performance of many students.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "I think one big way VIT can boost participation and success in external events is by making things a bit clearer and more student-friendly. For example, recently the VIT Film Society got the chance to go to Alliance One Fest, an inter-university event. A lot of us were excited, but many people backed out because CATs were going on and they weren\u2019t sure if they\u2019d be allowed to miss exams or make them up later. Later, we found out that rescheduling was actually possible\u2014but by then it was too late for some to join.\n\nIf students had clear info about academic flexibility and support when representing VIT, I\u2019m sure a lot more people would participate. On top of that, helping out with logistics like travel, registration, or even just encouraging clubs more actively could really help students feel confident and motivated to go out and represent the university.",

Back in high school, I won first place in two inter-school competitions for editing, and I got selected for two internships (Jurident and MossX) mainly because of my editing skills.

Many students, particularly girls, have the potential but lack the opportunity to train and grow.

      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "1. Addressing problems that are often overlooked.\n2. Public Relations, Media and Editorial Domains experiences (Communication)\n3. Project management (I have a 6 course Specialisation Certification from Coursera offered by Google on same)\n4. Data Analytics and Machine Learning using Python and R (have 3 Specialisation Certifications on this same topic)\n5. Conflict management.\n6. Teaching and training students in their subjects.\n7. Brainstorming and creative thinking and problem solving.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "1. Construction of cycle stands at each academic and hostel blocks ensuring all weather protection.\n2. Accessibility ramps at all academic and hostel blocks.\n3. Signboards in academic and hostel blocks regarding directions to room numbers (very helpful for students who are new and not used to a particular building) (especially in PRP)\n4. Automation in food courts by providing a screen with outstanding or unserved orders. This is the biggest concern because the waiters have to yell every single order to both the chefs as well as students (like DOSA, ROAST, etc. I noticed that they have a mental idea of how many dosas of every variety is pending, like I remember one waiter saying \"3 podi dosa. Motham 5\" \"4 plain dosa, motham 7\", etc. So, a screen on kitchen side can give live list of pending orders. Like the order pops up on screen after payment is done at cashier, then after food is prepared, a person in kitchen can remove that item from standing list. Then on serving side, there can be a token number or food available list with token number for customer to come and collect. Will reduce noise and better ambience in food courts.\n5. An enthusiastic and proactive Alumni Network. Like BITS Pilani, VIT must help alumni at all decades and help in building startups and support in times of need. Current issue has been that the Alumni group is only notified of Chancellor Sir's arrival but ghosting people in need of support to build startups.\n6.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "1. Increase funding for Teams and Chapters for participation in competitions worldwide and rewarding them if the team wins (like bearing travel and accommodation costs).\n2. A special letter of recommendation for students who took part in teams and chapters after winning competition(s) that will help them in internship, placement and higher studies.\n3. Provision of necessary equipment and materials for free or minimal costs. \n4. Cash prize for winners and certificates for participation."

I volunteered for the sales team during Gravitas'24 and Riviera'25, where I managed merchandise sales, marketing, publicity, and inventory. I also served as the Point of Contact for the GameDev Insights workshop during Gravitas'24, successfully organizing the event for 180 participants, coordinating with an external speaker, and managing logistics and documentation.

My organizational skills, event management experience, and ability to handle logistics make me a reliable team player.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One change that students often hope for but that tends to be overlooked is the need for inclusive spaces where introverted or shy individuals can express their talents without being pushed into the spotlight. Many students have exceptional skills like choreographing dances, designing posters, managing backstage operations, editing videos, or even writing scripts but hesitate to step forward due to stage fear or social anxiety. If given the opportunity, I would advocate for systems that recognize and utilize these talents in roles that suit their comfort zones. For example, a student with stage fear could choreograph a dance or work on creative direction, while someone good at writing but shy could contribute to event scripts or social media content. By actively identifying and encouraging such students, we can help them grow while also enriching the team with their creativity and skills.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "I believe VIT\u2019s success in external events hinges not just on talent, but on how well we discover, nurture, and showcase that talent. Often, the most creative and capable individuals remain in the shadows either due to lack of confidence or limited visibility. To change that, VIT can introduce a talent incubation initiative scouting potential through casual open mics, design jams, or dance cyphers, where participation feels less competitive and more collaborative. Building a culture of mentorship, where experienced performers or artists guide juniors, can also bridge the gap between potential and performance. More importantly, recognizing and celebrating off-stage contributions like scriptwriting, choreography, content creation, or tech support will make more students feel seen and valued. When every role is respected, every team becomes stronger, and VIT\u2019s presence at external events becomes not just bigger, but bolder."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

Most of the events that are conducted in the campus may not reach to everyone. If it is a very important to a particular branch it may not reach to every student who is interested in the event.\n\nIf given the opportunity, i would advocate it is taking a group that is frequently used by students . For example, there a lhf block group for fresher so many people seems active on that group so posting the event there. Posting a story on the event and not revealing like to make people excited about the event. Taking the instagram as main platform because most of the students are active on it. Frequent posts , reels may interest the people to come to the events.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT can enhance its participation and success in external events by early identification of new talents by conducting internal competition. So many freshers may not know how a club works and how events takes place in the initial days of college so by giving an awareness through internal competition we may find new talents. By promoting our achievements on social media not only show our success but also to motivate the new talents."

We also need a more streamlined system to make it easier for the students to take part in the events without it becoming a question of their studies or events.\nIf we meant external students taking part in events organized by us, we must find a way, ideally through social media to promote our events directly to the students, because communication through their official channels may not be the smoothest.",

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One often overlooked issue is the outdated curriculum in some courses, which doesn't always match industry standards. Students want more hands-on, relevant learning, but classes can sometimes rely too heavily on slides and rote teaching. If given the chance, I\u2019d work with student reps to gather feedback, push for regular curriculum reviews with industry input, and suggest faculty workshops to adopt more engaging, updated teaching methods."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "The major problem students are facing is they don't know where to express their issues or concerns. This leads to prolonging of issue and sometimes it is never solved.\nThe student council initiative to meet students on GDN G24 was successful to an extent, but still many of them are unaware of it, in spite of repeated mails.\nIf I was given a chance to solve this issue, my approach would be to construct a website / portal similar to VTOP, that uses VTOP credentials where students can submit their issues.\nWe can have a separate team that works on shifts to interpret the queries and guide the students through their solutions. The solutions should also be made public.\nIn this way, even if one student faces a problem that was already solved, they can make use of the Forum.\n\n\nApart from this, another major issue faced is smoking inside and outside the campus.\nI would urge the College to ban the selling of cigarettes outside of VIT, and impose heavy fines on those who are caught. However I believe creating a strong awareness is a key to solve this problem and we can create a team to sort out this issue."

Additionally, I can help bridge the gap between students and opportunities in fields like embedded systems, hackathons, and internships by sharing relevant resources and fostering a culture of learning and collaboration.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "Many students, especially in their first year, miss out on valuable opportunities because they don\u2019t receive proper guidance. While emails are sent out, the sheer number from different groups often causes important ones to get lost. As a result, students may never come across programs like the \"\"Institution Innovation Council (IIC), Chips to Startup (C2S), NPTEL-to-elective options, or national-level hackathons and projects from companies and company exposure\"\". \nTo solve this, I would advocate for a centralized, faculty-supported platform where all such opportunities are shared in a clear and timely manner. Faculty, being the main mentors and subject experts, can play a key role in selecting and sharing the right information. Along with this, a simple mentorship system where faculty help guide students through these options can go a long way in helping them make better academic and career choices."

Representing VIT University, we brought sports items, stationery, and most importantly, our time, knowledge, and encouragement. I contributed by teaching basic education and life skills to tribal children, fostering curiosity and confidence. I helped organize learning activities, promoted hygiene awareness, and built meaningful connections with the community, positively impacting their growth while representing VIT\u2019s commitment to inclusive social development. We introduced basic geography, discussed aspirations, and emphasized that education is a necessity, not a luxury. This initiative gave the children new perspectives and inspired the VIT community to stand for equity. It wasn\u2019t just a visit\u2014it was a promise to return, support, and uplift unheard voices.",

Not just a poster or a seminar once in a while, but actual spaces where we feel safe to open up without being judged. Sometimes it\u2019s not about solving everything, it\u2019s about being heard, without someone saying \u201ceveryone\u2019s stressed.\u201d We\u2019re balancing so much \u2014 academics, future plans, expectations \u2014 and it can get really heavy. I just wish more people in the system understood that. Honestly, even one empathetic listener on campus can make all the difference.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "In would encourage the following ideas:\n\n1) Creating a hype among students:\nThe campus must be filled with colourful posters and photo booths, creating polls and countdowns for the big day. \n2) Use Social Media and Campus Promotion: Promote the event effectively via social media, campus newsletters, and posters. Create excitement by sharing teasers, behind-the-scenes preparations, or even giveaways.\n3)Engaging Clubs/Chapters:\nInvolve student clubs or leaders in organizing or promoting the event. When peers are involved in the process, others are more likely to join.\n\nI worked in the sales team during Reviera\u201925 and it was fun getting all my friends buy merchs for me, overall the merch wasn\u2019t just a merch but a core memory of the season."

I believe many students want to start their projects at the beginning of second year but they are not aware of how to start or how to go about it . For introverts who are really good technically , In case they need help from other dept students for their project , there's no common forum , where students from all departments could discuss on projects and start working. I would suggest to develop a committee or board in VIT , with representatives from each branch of each academic year are members , they could create a forum like LinkedIn group or maybe club which updates every new things. They could put up a Project Opening where students can apply and start working on it . \n\n2.In Quantitative and Qualitative Course that we have in our first and second year , the students face a lot of trouble in the absolute grading system given to that subject , when questions given to all students are different. The level of difficulty is different of different students.Many students feel the basis of evaluation does not seem to be fair . I would advocate to convert the grading system to relative or give the students same set of questions in a jumbled order based on the time of login, so that the evaluation in fair.",

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One important issue often overlooked at VIT is the limited visibility and accessibility of mental health support systems. While services are available, many students remain unaware of them or feel uncomfortable seeking help due to stigma or lack of outreach.\n\nAs the Acting Chairperson of the Centre for Social Entrepreneurship and Development (CSED), I\u2019ve consistently worked on initiatives that create social impact and foster community well-being. This makes mental health advocacy especially close to me. If given the opportunity, I would propose launching a student-led mental wellness collective in collaboration with the university\u2019s counseling cell. This initiative would focus on peer support groups, awareness campaigns, and interactive events aimed at destigmatizing mental health and making support more accessible. By integrating these efforts into the student ecosystem, we can build a more empathetic, informed, and resilient campus environment.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "In my opinion, VIT can significantly enhance its participation and success in external events by cultivating a culture of early exposure and structured preparation among students, especially from their first year. Many students miss out on prestigious opportunities simply because they aren\u2019t aware of them early enough or don\u2019t feel adequately prepared.\n\nTo bridge this gap, VIT could introduce a dedicated initiative called \u201cLaunchPad: Ready for the Real World\u201d. This program would feature semester-wise sessions led by seniors, alumni, and faculty\u2014covering everything from hackathons and business plan contests to international conferences and innovation challenges. Through hands-on workshops, mentorship, and mock events, students would gain the skills and confidence needed to compete at high levels.\n\nAs the Acting Chairperson of CSED, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how timely mentorship and guided exposure can unlock a student\u2019s full potential. LaunchPad would not just prepare students\u2014it would launch them toward national and global impact."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One improvement that is often overlooked is better mental health support for students. While the academic pressure can be intense, students often feel the need to keep pushing through without discussing their struggles openly. More accessible and visible mental health resources could significantly reduce the stigma around mental well-being.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for dedicated mental health awareness campaigns, increased access to counseling services, and stress-relief activities on campus.

I would initiate inter-club technical collaborations, where clubs with complementary strengths can co-host hackathons, build real-world tech products, or solve campus-level problems.\n\nAdditionally, I would create a centralized technical project repository and dashboard, where ongoing student-led innovations can be showcased, encouraging contributions and recognition. By organizing regular open project nights, technical mentorship sessions, and cross-chapter tech bootcamps, we can increase participation and foster a vibrant, skill-driven ecosystem that scales beyond isolated events.",

I'd also gather student feedback through open forums and surveys to identify specific skills in demand, then work with faculty to design elective modules or credit-based practical courses addressing those gaps.

Structured workshops, mock competitions, and performance feedback sessions would significantly improve quality and confidence.\n\nBetter Coordination and Visibility:\nCreate a centralized Cultural Events Cell with representatives from every cultural club to keep track of upcoming external events and ensure timely registrations, sponsorship support, and logistics planning. Promote VIT\u2019s cultural achievements through official social media handles to build a stronger identity in the external cultural circuit.\n\nIf selected as Member Secretary - Cultural, I\u2019d prioritize building this structured framework to make VIT\u2019s presence felt consistently and successfully on national and international cultural platforms"

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community..1": "Being part of the VIT community has been such a fulfilling experience for me. As the Co-Secretary of Bulls and Bears, the largest finance club on campus, I\u2019ve had the chance to organize and host some really exciting events like Cashflow 3.0, Dalal Street 2.0, Casinova 3.0, and Bear the Bull during Riviera. I also conducted a stock market basics session for first-years, which was a great way to share what I\u2019ve learned so far. Apart from that, I volunteered for finance events during Riviera and helped out wherever I could. I\u2019m also part of Aiche-VIT, where I get to explore my interest in chemical engineering. It\u2019s been a mix of learning, fun, and being part of something bigger\u2014and I\u2019ve loved every bit of it.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "Over time, I\u2019ve realized that my strengths lie in effective communication, event planning, and leading with a sense of clarity and enthusiasm. I enjoy coordinating with teams, managing responsibilities, and ensuring that things are executed smoothly\u2014even in high-pressure situations. I work best in dynamic environments where I can take initiative, stay organized, and still bring a positive, engaging energy to the table. I believe I can contribute most effectively in roles that involve planning, execution, and interaction with people\u2014especially where creativity and structure go hand in hand.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "I believe it would be helpful if teachers could show more flexibility and understanding towards students balancing academics with extracurricular activities. Many students, especially those involved in clubs and events, often struggle to meet deadlines due to time commitments. I would advocate for more considerate approaches, such as flexible deadlines or additional support during busy times, which would allow students to perform well both academically and in their extracurriculars.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "I believe VIT can enhance its participation and success in external events by focusing on better preparation and team coordination. Encouraging students to collaborate across departments, providing more practice sessions, and offering guidance from previous participants could really help. A little more support and encouragement for students to build confidence and skills could make a big difference. By creating a more connected and prepared environment, VIT can stand out and perform even better in external competitions."

I\u2019ve also volunteered in the hospitality and accommodation domain for SCHEMCON, a prestigious chemical engineering conference to be held at VIT.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "As vit is already an reputated college among all over the world and for participation most of the students in vit is not even getting the information about the events so creating an page in social media were all the external events will be shared and giving on duty permission for participation in competition will increase the participation and for success in external events More guest lecture , hackathon , workshops to be conducted so that the students will extra knowledge and experience which will be helpful in winning the competition"

This discourages participation among students in various events as attendance plays a crucial role in order to be eligible to write exams. \nWe can digitalise similar queries by adding a section on vtop wherein the HoD or the authorised staffs can approve ODs, Travel compensation (if applicable), etc.\nThis will save time for students as well as for faculties who have more important work to do.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "Being member of a technical club myself, it frustrates me how slow the operations of the clubs happen. Most of the clubs conduct workshops on similar , basic topics and use repeated concept and slides to conduct it. It feels like there is no passion involved and they do it for the sake of doing it \nI would personally love to see a few things happening. First, workshops from basic to advanced level of a topic conducted in parts at regular intervals (say 15 days). This will ensure that people feel connected to the club and keep showing up to attend the next part of the workshop and actually learn something unlike going in loops of HTML and CSS. \nThen all the Technical clubs should be made to do complete a given number of meaningful projects (the number can be based on the size of the club). This ensures the club members are actually learning and not just making websites for the fest events. \nTo remove the misuse of ODs by clubs and chapters, both the organisers and all the attendees must be made to submit a short report at the end of the event to the DSW (digitally preferably) for the OD processing. \nThis will ensure learning and spending quality time at the club ,but not at the expense of ODs",

      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "I feel that our college should allow students to form designated teams for almost all the events , no matter how small the event is, so as to increase our participation . This will not only enhance our reputation and networking , but also encourage more students to come up and form teams where they think they specialise. \nWith the number of students in our college, I have no doubt that we can win any competition in any college or organisation if we promote the event and encourage participation by removing the hassles for basic incentives like ODs, travel compensations and exam reschedulements. This will push students to participate and earn glory for our institution.\nContinous recruitment drives for teams for all competitions will further encourage students to try their hand at any point and help us to get better players to send from our college.",

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

However, when faced with subjects like Java, Python, and OOPS, which are very essential to gain them skills, the focus often shifts to achieving good grades rather than developing proficiency in these areas. Students want to learn skills, but grades often take precedence, leading them to prioritize academic performance over practical application.\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for a shift in focus towards skills-based learning by encouraging students to do projects based on real life using those skills and grade them according to it . We can gather data to quantify student experience and build collations among students, faculty, and potential funders to secure resources and support for practical projects and skills-based initiatives."

The P&M team should collaborate with the cultural sector and make the best out of it. External events are a great opportunity to motivate students, as competitions are alone a good way to motivate but if they are external, amazing opportunity. We need to be attentive about the external events forms when they come out so that we can apply and thrive there."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "Students are many-a-times discouraged from participating in external events because of the frequent exams that VIT's Academic Calendar facilitates. This is bad for the university too, as I have personally seen a lot of talented students backing out from events because they do not want to give reCATs and take a risk with academics, as reCATs are quite flexible and teachers tend to give a difficult paper in such reCATs. VIT is losing out on a lot of potential awards and honours due to this. The reCAT structure should thus be structured better so that faculties can't make the paper easy or difficult based on their personal descretion; just like normal CATs.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT needs to contribute with a lot more colleges when it comes to external events, such as MUNs, cultural fests, etc. and build rapport in this regard. When VIT will take initiative and send participants to other colleges; these colleges will out of courtesy take efforts to send participants in VIT's cultural fests. When it comes to success in external events, that can happen only by proper training structures. For example, VIT MUNSoc has a concrete training structure for the juniors who join the club every year, and within a short period of time, they start winning awards for the university. Similar measures can be taken with respect to other domains too."

Many students require spaces for collaborative work, especially during peak exam periods, but these are often limited.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One critical yet overlooked issue is the declining value of VIT's clubs/chapters, which have become more about resume-building and revenue than meaningful student development. Many chapters host superficial events while lacking real skill-building opportunities or ethical leadership. As Secretary, I would advocate for change by instituting annual performance reviews to restructure inactive chapters, introducing transparent financial reporting, and reviving merit-based incentives like ODs for active contributors. I'd also bridge connections with alumni from VIT's \"golden era\" of clubs to mentor current members and refocus chapters on hands-on learning. My goal would be to transform these spaces from transactional resume boosters back into platforms that genuinely foster technical growth, teamwork, and leadership\u2014aligning with both student needs and VIT's academic mission.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "As Member Secretary - Cultural, I will enhance VIT's external event participation by implementing a structured talent development program, including auditions, expert-led workshops, and mock competitions to prepare teams. I'll forge collaborations with professional artists and alumni while leveraging VIT's technical strengths to create innovative performances. To boost motivation, I'll establish recognition systems like awards and social media spotlights for winners, while ensuring robust logistical and financial support for participating teams. These initiatives will elevate VIT's cultural reputation and competitive success in intercollegiate events.",

Creating a culture where senior students actively mentor juniors instead of intimidating them would foster a more positive environment."

Also, we should post our events on platforms such and unstop in advance to spread information about our events."

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community..1": "I am the vice captain of the VIT Women's Cricket Team. Our team had won the Gold in the Chief Minister's Trophy Tournament which was held in September 2024. This was the first time VIT had ever won the CM trophy in women's cricket category. It was such a proud moment, and I\u2019m happy to have played a part in creating a milestone for women\u2019s sports at our university. I had also participated and won in several tournaments in our university level. Apart from sports, i have been actively involved in workshops related to Information Technology, AI and machine learning.I\u2019m also a part of Toastmasters, where I\u2019ve been contributing to the public speaking and leadership culture on campus.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "My strongest skills include communication, teamwork, empathy, leadership, and event planning. I have previously served as the sports captain for the student council at my school and have led teams in both academics and athletics. I gained knowledge about how to unite individuals in pursuit of common goals while making sure that each person feels valued and included in these positions. The greatest ways I can assist, in my opinion, are by creating a supportive learning environment for students, organizing events that encourage participation from a range of groups, and working on initiatives that prioritize mental health and wellness.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One of the key but frequently underappreciated enhancements is the necessity for more robust mental health support within the university. Numerous students quietly struggle with stress, academic stress, and homesickness, but do not always know where to seek help. As a student council member, I would take the initiative to push for more accessible and student-centered counseling services, initiate mental health awareness campaigns, and implement peer-support programs facilitated by trained student volunteers. I\u2019d work closely with faculty and administration to establish safe spaces for open conversations and organize regular workshops to normalize discussions around mental well-being. My goal would be to make sure no student feels alone in their struggles."

While I haven\u2019t participated in too many events, my focus has been on building strong technical skills and maintaining academic excellence. I\u2019m currently the second-best student in my branch (Blockchain).

I\u2019m currently also exploring Machine Learning and working with ArduPilot systems as part of my preparation for NIDAR 2025, where I\u2019ll be representing VIT along with my teammates.\nI think I can best contribute by facilitating and managing technical operations, developing digital platforms, and facilitating smooth coordination between technical and non-technical teams, making me a strong fit for the role of Member Secretary or Technical Member Secretary.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One thing students often overlook is the importance of building their resume and LinkedIn profile early on. Most of us wait until we \u201clearn enough\u201d before starting these, but honestly, that\u2019s not the right mindset. Making a resume or LinkedIn in the first year itself\u2014even if it's mostly empty\u2014gives you a clear view of what\u2019s missing and pushes you to fill those gaps through projects, internships, or open-source work.\nIf I get the chance, I\u2019d love to help students get started early, conduct peer-to-peer sessions where we build resumes together, talk about platforms like GitHub and LinkedIn, and introduce them to small projects or open-source contributions\u2014because getting started is the hardest part, and no one should do it alone.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "One problem I\u2019ve noticed is that students are often selected for clubs based on their current skill level, but many join for networking or resume building rather than a genuine desire to grow or contribute. This kind of selection process holds back the clubs and limits their potential.\n\nOn top of that, a lot of clubs organize events just to have something on the calendar\u2014without considering their value. Most of these events don\u2019t end up being useful or effective in the long run, and that leads to missed opportunities for real learning.\n\nTo truly make an impact, we need to focus on students who are genuinely interested in learning and growing, even if they don't have all the skills yet. The clubs should create opportunities for hands-on projects, mentorship, and real-world exposure. Events should be planned with a clear goal in mind things like practical workshops, collaborative projects, and industry interactions that help students actually build useful skills,know about the technical market, lectures from seasoned professionals and all.\n\nIf we do this, we\u2019ll create a culture where every event or activity adds real value and makes a difference in students\u2019 journeys, rather than just being something to tick off.",

If said changes are reasonable, I would take it up with the concerned faculty member and discuss ways in which the changes could be implemented."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One major change students often hope for but that tends to get overlooked should be proper guidance, a healthy living environment, and support for mental well-being. Many students feel lost or overwhelmed, especially when academics become intense without enough support. If I had the chance, I\u2019d advocate for clearer mentorship programs, more open conversations around mental health, and efforts to make academic expectations more realistic and manageable.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT could do a lot to boost participation by offering better resources for students to prepare, helping with travel and accommodation that will reduce the logistical stress and making sure that academic pressure doesn\u2019t hold them back. It would also help if there was more regular support and encouragement from faculty to keep students motivated."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "- One improvement often overlooked is the need for structured mental health awareness and stress-relief opportunities for students. While VIT has some support systems in place, many students are still unaware of them or hesitant to reach out. Academic pressure, hostel life, and being away from home can silently affect students\u2019 well-being. If given the opportunity, I would advocate for regular peer-led sessions, awareness drives, and visible resources \u2014 possibly even a student-run support initiative in collaboration with the wellness team. My goal would be to normalize these conversations and make support feel more accessible, not intimidating.\n\n- Many students are not very aware about plastic use, energy waste, and cleanliness, but there\u2019s no structured student involvement in sustainability practices. If I had the chance, I\u2019d introduce a \u201cGreen VIT Squad\u201d \u2014 a student-led initiative to run eco challenges, like plastic-free weeks, e-waste collection, and creative recycling events.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "- Creating a central digital hub or noticeboard (on VTOP or student platforms) that regularly lists upcoming external competitions, conferences, and events across fields.\n\n- Encouraging faculty or senior student mentorship for teams, especially those participating for the first time.\n\n- Create a directory of faculty or alumni mentors (especially past winners) who can advise teams on strategy, submissions, and presentation and mentorship can make the difference between just participating and actually winning.\n\n- Organize skill-building sessions specific to external events \u2014 like pitch training, design presentation, or competition writing (e.g., for NASA, Smart India Hackathon, moot courts, etc.) as it prepares students with the skills and confidence needed to perform under pressure."

If given an opportunity, I would try to make a strict in-time of all the students at 7:00pm sharp and I would also make sure that every student gets 2 hours outing during instructional days and 4 hours of outing during non instructional days.

Also, they should provide certificates to the participants for their performances so that they get motivated to perform in more and more internal and external events.

Autos charge excessively, and the prices of carton boxes, tapes, and mattress covers are unfairly inflated due to students\u2019 urgency. This leads to financial stress and exploitation. If selected, I would advocate for a regulated system involving approved vendors with transparent, student-friendly pricing. Additionally, I would propose a sustainable solution where students can return usable packing materials\u2014like boxes and mattress covers\u2014after the break. These can be stored and resold at lower prices to incoming students, promoting reuse, reducing waste, and saving money. This not only supports affordability but also aligns with VIT\u2019s sustainability goals."

Not to mention I had to realize the different requirements and strategies required for the foreign students. Hence I believe my experience allows me to be a proper bridge between students of any background and the administration ensuring minimal difficulties for either party.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "A common concern of all the students is regarding their information and communication with the higher authorities. Specifically, regarding the proper setting of timelines, dues, events alongside the circulation of important notices. In a couple of cases, many changes are suddenly brought forth which has a great impact upon the students. For example, last year when the Pongal holidays were extended, the information had been passed very late and as such, many people had booked the holidays including that and some extra days. This caused a lot of students and faculties to be concerned and bothered with the student attendance debar policy. Also resolved, it had to be done by bending the premade regulations of criteria.\n\nAs a member secretary it would be my job to be aware and highlight this issues at their earliest as information and transparent communication is very, very vital in ensuring a harmony between students and administration while maintaining smooth day to day operations. In the case of any events, holidays or new policies, I would ensure these details are not overlooked and also make sure there is no unnecessary operations to be done to resolve the same."

Also a lot of students don't understand why we need to get our leaves approved by wardens and not proctor. Proctor having to deal with a limited amount of people might be less stressed because of having to Deal with only a limited number of students and they already know the students as well. In case of something a person might be uncomfortable going to their proctor for, they should have the option to also go to the warden's.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "One very particular thing I recently experienced was I saw a t shirt from a random club from a random college on insta.

Doing such a thing might not only increase external participation but also increase sales of the t shirt as well as be a really good experience for the designers. https://www.instagram.com/p/DGq33KIIItZ/?img_index=2&igsh=OXoydXlmODJ4dWg="

For this reason most of the students does not participate in many events . As being said Events being more underrated in VIT ,its not that true ,As per my experience At start I didn't know about any events for months .So that is the reason people are mot getting details about the events .\n\nIf I would have given the opportunity ,I would upgrade the PR teams of the club and also give them a perfect timing to give the details of event, also I will ask them to make it curious what is about to happen in the event in a suspenseful manner . Also I will upgrade the benefitting system of clubs, i.e more prizes will be introduced for the clubs , So that the club member should get extra energy to work on the event , And make it more successful and the members would be devoted more to the club.\nI have many more ideas For the betterment of students.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "To expand the Technical Segment of chapters and clubs to reach more broadly, it is important to strengthen industry alliances, sponsor flagship activities like hackathons, and promote cross-disciplinary projects that blend technical and non-technical skills. Providing structured member development through workshops, mentorship, and leadership development will develop talent, while expanding outreach and diversity will attract a diverse range of students. In addition, using online platforms for learning and engagement can extend beyond the campus and create long-term value for members.",

      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "To enhance performance and involvement in outside competitions, a college must focus on early identification and development of talented students through mentorship, mock competitions, and training programs. Institutional support with flexible scheduling, resources, and financial assistance makes effective team preparation easier. Cross-disciplinary teaming can enhance team capabilities, and a culture of rewarding and recognizing success can encourage more students to participate in competitions. Building relationships with industry professionals and alumni can offer valuable insights and enhance the competitiveness of the college in outside environments."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One aspect that I feel is often overlooked is the communication between the Student Welfare team and the student body. There are several instances where the decisions made by SW aren\u2019t well-received by students\u2014not necessarily because they\u2019re wrong, but perhaps because they aren\u2019t well understood. I completely acknowledge that it's impossible to please everyone, but I believe a noticeable communication gap exists that could be bridged with more transparent and consistent dialogue. Strengthening this connection could lead to better mutual understanding and a more positive campus environment.\n\nA digital suggestion/feedback box accessible to all students.\n\nRepresentation of students in certain SW discussions for better two-way feedback.\n\n\nI believe this approach will not only improve trust but also ensure that students feel heard and valued in the decision-making ecosystem.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "One thing I\u2019ve personally experienced\u2014and I know a lot of others would agree\u2014is how tough it gets to balance college and competition prep. When you're working on serious projects or representing VIT in competitions, it\u2019s not uncommon to be up till 1 AM or even 6 AM. And then having to attend 8 or 9 AM classes right after that can really take a toll on your health.\n\nI think the OD process for such situations should be made simpler and quicker. Right now, it\u2019s a bit of a hassle, and that discourages people from fully committing to these events. If there were a smoother system\u2014maybe a digital form or auto-approval for recognized team members\u2014it would really help students give their best without burning out or falling behind in class.",

They\u2019re a great way to learn the basics of pacing, scene selection, and impact.\n\nBack then, I used KineMaster on my phone and used to look up to big creators with millions of followers, wondering how they achieved that level of polish. Eventually, I moved on to a more advanced software\u2014Magix Vegas Pro. That was my first step into professional editing. I dedicated myself to learning every feature of the software and consistently posted edits to refine my skills.\n\nDuring this time, I also reached out to fellow creators, seeking guidance and mentorship. Their feedback helped shape my growth, both creatively and technically. After a year of working with Vegas Pro, I transitioned to Adobe After Effects, which I believe is the most powerful editing tool out there.\n\nThis journey has spanned over seven years\u2014from experimenting with a basic app to mastering professional-grade software\u2014and it\u2019s been one of constant learning, creativity, and evolution.",

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "VIT is really great college with great infrastructure and management.The only complaints students mostly come up with it is the fact that how controlled our Iives feel but I get the fact if we at this age aren't controlled we are more likely to take some wrong steps in life which we might regret later on.So,\nthe only problem which I thing is an issue that can be worked upon is the outing time of girls on weekdays which is just 2 hours while even though boys are said to have the same outing time they can exceed it as per their wish.One can say it's for a girl's safety but still atleast an outing time of 4hr each day won't be a problem as if something has to happen in those 4 hrs can happen in those 2 hrs too.The in time is reasonable 7 pm and it starts getting dark.Although being a member of LHSC and someone who thinks about welfare of girls,I think its not reasonable to impose such restrictions towards girls as it will only make them feel like they will always have to compromise while other gender need not to ,creating gender differences and a feeling of inferiority. Even though no matter how many times VIT imposes these rules on boys they are always bend but when it comes to girls huge intensity of actions are taken and it is something that can be easily resolved and I will if get a chance to do my outmost best to make girls outings for 4 hr even of weekdays.",

      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "In a college like VIT if a student is dedicating their time for cultural events this might effect their marks and maybe that is something which might hold students back .\nSo in my opinion for the students who have valuable cultural contributions should be given extra marks for it under 'Additional contributions' some concept like 'Additional learning'.This factor itself will motivate people to go and increase their competitiveness knowing that they can do the things they enjoy and get marks for it . \nThis might come as unfair to students who dedicate all their time studying but I think if a student is dedicating their time to get a name for college they should be given some edge in academics because their valuable time is dedicated somewhere else."

To enhance participation, the university should explore alternative communication channels, such as a centralized app or notifications on the official VIT platform.

Many shy away from opportunities due to a lack of confidence, and this is often not addressed. If given the opportunity, I would advocate for initiatives that promote peer mentorship, accessible volunteer roles, and low-pressure events.

A stronger support system and improved communication can better prepare teams and boost VIT's performance in external events."

And when they do, they often resort to scrolling on their phones or isolating in their rooms, which only adds to eye strain, mental fatigue, and feelings of disconnection. I would advocate for device-free, de-stress zones and activities on campus\u2014simple yet effective events like evening unplugged music circles, board games or chai & talk sessions.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One key improvement students often seek is a smoother experience during events\u2014whether it's Gravitas, Riviera, or the Yantra Hackathon.\nUnfortunately, sometimes due to confusion regarding the rules and regulations there are issues. Addressing these issues would significantly enhance the overall event experience.\n\nTo advocate for this, I would propose conducting events with clear, fixed guidelines. For example, in the case of overnight events, participants should receive an email in advance outlining important details\u2014such as access to washrooms, arrival and departure times, and any other logistical information. This would minimize confusion and improve preparedness. Moreover, volunteers should be properly briefed and trained to handle situations politely and efficiently, ensuring a more seamless and respectful environment for all attendees.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "To enhance participation and ensure success in external events, preparations should begin well in advance. A dedicated team should be assigned to oversee the readiness, manage logistics, and address any issues related to these events.\n\nStudents should be actively encouraged to participate through expos, social media campaigns, and awareness sessions. Greater participation often leads to improved quality and performance. It is also important to educate students about the value and opportunities these events provide.\n\nAdditionally, staying informed about upcoming events is crucial so that no opportunity is missed."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One key improvement that is often overlooked is the need for better networking opportunities and targeted career guidance. While there are many academic and extracurricular activities, students often struggle to find direct connections with industry professionals and alumni who can guide them through internships, job applications, and skill development. Many students are unsure about which skills are most in demand and how to prepare effectively for the professional world. If given the opportunity, I would advocate for creating structured mentorship programs, industry networking events, and skill-building workshops tailored to different domains. Additionally, a centralized career resource platform where students can access guidance and job opportunities would significantly enhance their chances of securing meaningful careers.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "In my opinion, the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters can be expanded to achieve greater impact by fostering a culture of collaborative innovation and real-world problem solving. One way to do this is by actively organizing hackathons, workshops, and seminars that focus on cutting-edge technologies like AI, machine learning, blockchain, and IoT. These events can bring students from diverse backgrounds together, allowing them to collaborate, share ideas, and work on projects that address real-world challenges.\nAdditionally, forming partnerships with industry experts and start-ups to offer mentorship and internship opportunities can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical experience. Encouraging cross-departmental collaboration\u2014for example, involving students from CSE, ECE, Mechanical, and other streams\u2014will promote a more interdisciplinary approach to problem solving.\nLastly, integrating research and development into club activities can be a game-changer. Students can collaborate on long-term projects, present their findings, and even contribute to open-source platforms. This will not only enhance technical skills but also provide visibility and recognition to the club members and chapters.",
      "Select the domains in which you are skilled.": "Web Development (Frontend), Web Development (Backend), Full Stack Development, Machine Learning",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "In my opinion, VIT can enhance its participation and success in external events by creating a more structured and collaborative approach towards student participation and skill development. First, pre-event preparation can be strengthened by conducting internal training sessions, workshops, and mock events tailored to the specific competition or event. This will ensure that students are well-prepared with the required technical and soft skills.\nSecond, creating a support system where mentors (such as senior students, faculty, or industry professionals) guide the participants throughout the preparation and competition phases can significantly improve outcomes. This mentorship system will not only help in skill-building but will also boost the confidence of students.\nThird, VIT can introduce interdisciplinary teams for external events, where students from different departments or clubs collaborate and bring diverse perspectives. For instance, a team for a hackathon can include students from CSE, ECE, Design, and Business backgrounds to create a well-rounded, innovative solution. This approach will lead to collaboration and knowledge-sharing.\nLastly, fostering a feedback-driven culture where students who participate in external events share their experiences and learnings with others is crucial. This will create a continuous improvement cycle that encourages others to participate as well and learn from past experiences."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One big change students want\u2014but rarely get\u2014is a real say in what and how they learn. Most of us have sat through classes thinking, \"Why are we learning this?\" or \"This could be so much more interesting if...\" But even though we\u2019re the ones doing the learning, nobody really asks us.\n\nIf I had to push for this, I\u2019d start simple:\n\nActually listen to students. Surveys are nice, but they often feel like a checkbox. Instead, teachers or admins could hold open discussions where students honestly share what works and what doesn\u2019t\u2014without fear of it being ignored.\n\nGet students in the room where decisions happen. Right now, curriculum changes are decided by admins, professors, or policymakers who haven\u2019t been students in years. Why not have a few students sit in on those meetings?\n\nLet students co-design at least one unit or project. Even small choices\u2014like picking between two books, deciding on a final project format, or suggesting guest speakers\u2014can make learning feel more relevant.\n\nShow proof it works. Point to schools that do listen to students and have better engagement because of it. Numbers talk, but so do student testimonials."

If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One change i would want to bring in VIT is better crowd management and sometimes students don't know the opportunities that are available to them. As for crowd management it really depends on the situation but there should be a flexible system built and authority should be appropriately delegated. I also think that certain good students might get badly influenced due to other students and there should be more proactive approach towards this.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "The technical sector can be expanded in terms when students get an emergency, example when a student messes up their FFCS due to technical issues and inst able to get any credits, or when there is a technical glitch for a quizes or exams. In such cases one should be able to get in touch with them at the moment to figure things out easily and faster.",
      "Select the domains in which you are skilled.": "Web Development (Frontend)",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT can enhance participation and success in external events by keeping more flexible auditions for them. As sometimes people aren't available at certain times and reauditions are not conducted. VIT should also talent hunt more publically. Yes in such a big crowd it's hard to do so but some people feel getting selected is out of reach while being super talented this can be due to the rigidness of the system or sometimes it's hard to approach someone to talk about the entire process hence having a help desk at all times is essential.",

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One commonly overlooked improvement students often want is better integration of academic resources with real-world skill-building opportunities, such as hands-on workshops, internships, or project-based learning tailored to their fields. While the curriculum is strong, many students feel a gap between classroom learning and industry expectations.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for this by creating a student-led initiative in collaboration with faculty and industry mentors to organize regular technical bootcamps, domain-specific competitions, and a centralized platform for internal project showcases and internship opportunities. I\u2019d use my technical and organizational skills to design the platform, gather student feedback, and ensure these initiatives are sustained and inclusive."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "**SHUTTLE SERVICE** The shuttle service is one of the most beneficial service provided by the college to the students within the campus. Unfortunately this service has become oversaturated. With newer S and T hostel blocks coming up, the number of students requiring to use the shuttle service to reach the main gate or library and academic blocks have been rising, which the current fleet of shuttle busses are not being to cope with. During rush hours Shuttle busses are often packed to the brim with student flocking into the aisle which do not have any railings to hold while standing and some hanging out of the door in the extreme case. These kind of situations happen very often and are very risky . Moreover recently personally I have noticed none of the AC in the busses to be functioning properly. Therefore even the tiny amount of 20 rupees to avail this service seem to not be worth it.\nI would like to advocate this problem by firstly bringing it unto concerned authorities' notice and then felicitate a complete yet sustainable overhaul of the whole shuttle service system.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT can enhance participation and success in competitions by asking the related club and chapters and also DSW to conduct motivational sessions where the students are introduced and pumped up into the idea of representing the university in competitions."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One change that students often want but is frequently overlooked is the improvement in the availability and quality of campus study spaces. While there are common areas like libraries, many students struggle with overcrowding during peak hours, which affects productivity and focus. If given the opportunity, I would advocate for the expansion of quiet study zones, better distribution of resources like Wi-Fi and power outlets, and more flexible hours for existing facilities. Additionally, incorporating feedback from students about specific needs, such as group study rooms or spaces conducive to online learning, would significantly enhance the learning environment and support students\u2019 academic success.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "Elevating VIT's success in external events requires a strategic shift towards proactive engagement and robust support, beginning with the cultivation of a vibrant internal competitive landscape. This involves early talent identification coupled with targeted skill development programs and dedicated mentorship, further incentivized through internal competitions that serve as a platform to showcase abilities and select promising candidates for external representation. Streamlining institutional resources, such as funding and recognition, will further empower these students and faculty to confidently represent VIT Vellore on external platforms. By fostering a culture that values and promotes participation, starting from within, and celebrates achievements, we can significantly enhance its visibility, build valuable external networks, and foster a stronger sense of institutional pride."

Then finally collaborating is important we can conduct a lot of inter schools event so that we can identify passionate people and by which we can ensure success in external events."

If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One of the most important areas that is often overlooked is to increase transparency and enhance student participation in important academic decisions, such as minor course selection, grading policy and its changes and scheduling of important academic events. To improve this, I would advocate for introduction of formal student representation in the respective academic committees and creation of stronger channels for student feedback. In addition, I would delegate for transparent and timely explanations for academic modifications, fostering a more cooperative and informed student community.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "Identifying talent effectively involves seeing beyond individual performances. This can be achieved by conducting skill-based workshops. These interactive sessions can provide a low pressure environments to bring out individual strengths and uncover latent talents. Through diligent observation of participation, interest, and innovative problem-solving strategies during these workshops, we can identify potential individuals. Then, following up with the individuals and matching them with senior student mentors can help develop the confidence necessary to actively engage and succeed in external events. This welcoming effort, as we promote newer members to discover their strengths and develop within the Quiz Club, can really expand VIT's visibility and achievement."

I think it's high time we change this. If I get the chance, I'll push for better promotion of these opportunities so more students can get involved and really experience campus life of VIT."

Council members can review this and submit a report for each week to DSW.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT is home to many hidden talents. To encourage greater participation, students who take part in external events\u2014regardless of whether they win\u2014should be recognized by the administration. This acknowledgment will boost their morale and inspire others to step forward. To enhance our success in such events, we will identify areas where we are currently lacking and form dedicated groups of students who excel in those specific fields to represent VIT."

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community..1": "At VIT, I have taken on multifaceted leadership and technical roles, contributing actively across student chapters, technical domains, and cultural initiatives. As a senior core member of the IEEE chapter, I have managed responsibilities across the technical, management, and design domains. I conducted an introductory session on backend web development for enthusiastic freshers, covering core technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Additionally, I contribute regularly to the official IEEE VIT Medium page, writing on technology and cybersecurity topics.\n\nIn major IEEE-led events such as Hack the Hackathon and Labyrinth during Gravitas, I was part of the organizing team, overseeing planning and execution. I also volunteered at Yantra \u2013 Synapse, where I guided participants by evaluating their designs and assisting with technical mentorship.\n\nBeyond technical pursuits, I serve as the Design Head of BBC (Bollywood Badmash Company), the official Bollywood dance crew of VIT. I lead the design front for the team\u2019s social media, creating visual content on platforms like Instagram using Figma and Canva. As part of this team, I represented VIT at IIT Bombay Mood Indigo, where we secured a place in the Top 8, and also performed at Vibrance, VIT Chennai\u2019s cultural fest.\n\nMy managerial and collaborative strengths are rooted in a diverse background of academics, arts, and sports. During school, I earned numerous laurels in swimming at district and state levels, and qualified for nationals under the ASISC board. I also actively competed in kho-kho, badminton, and basketball at the district level, leading my school teams in multiple inter-school and external tournaments. I served as the Sports Head and Discipline Head in my final year, and was also a guitarist in the school band Destiny. In addition, I have hosted and anchored various debate competitions, and both technical and cultural events\u2014developing strong communication, leadership, and event management capabilities.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "Leadership & Team Management: Proven leadership in technical, cultural, and sports domains, having served as a senior core member in IEEE, Sports Head in school, and Design Head for a university-level dance team. Skilled at motivating teams, coordinating large-scale events, and leading by example across varied disciplines.\n\nCommunication & Public Speaking: Experienced in hosting and anchoring a variety of debates, technical presentations, and cultural events. Adept at conveying ideas clearly, whether in formal settings or collaborative environments, such as during backend development sessions for freshers.\n\nMultitasking & Execution: Successfully managed multiple high-responsibility roles across tech, design, writing, and performance\u2014demonstrating strong organizational and time-management skills under pressure.\n\nAdaptability & Versatility: Highly adaptable to different environments, capable of transitioning smoothly between roles and responsibilities. Known for molding effectively to the needs of the team or situation, whether leading or supporting.\n\nIntegrity & Team Loyalty: Strong personal values guide my leadership\u2014I firmly stand by what is right, take ownership of responsibilities, and always back up and support my team, especially in high-pressure or uncertain situations.\n\nCreative & Technical Thinking: Combines technical knowledge with creative instincts, bringing well-rounded perspectives to problem-solving in both backend development and visual communication design.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One important change I believe the Student Council must address is the lack of equal recognition for students who contribute significantly in both academic and cultural spheres. While academic achievements are often celebrated, the dedication and hard work students put into cultural activities\u2014be it dance, music, design, or event participation\u2014often go unacknowledged. I\u2019ve seen many students juggle both domains with immense effort, and yet their contributions are overlooked simply because they don\u2019t fall within traditional academic expectations.\n\nMoreover, I believe that true leadership starts with understanding individuals. Too often, students with high potential go unnoticed because they don\u2019t receive the personal guidance they need. I would introduce a one-to-one student mentorship initiative under the Council to ensure every student has someone to turn to\u2014whether for guidance, encouragement, or just to be heard. This would help bring out the best in each individual and ensure no talent goes unnoticed simply because of a lack of individual attention.\n\nI lead with integrity, always stand by what\u2019s right, and back my team no matter the challenge. With my experience in managing events, mentoring peers, designing for impact, and performing under pressure, I bring adaptability, empathy, and a strong sense of responsibility to the table. As a Student Council member, I will strive to make VIT a place where every student's effort is seen, valued, and nurtured.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "Many students engage in tech clubs only during major fests or one-off events. To change that, I propose a more year-round engagement model that includes:\n\nSkill Development Tracks: Introduce tiered learning programs (beginner to advanced) within clubs that focus on in-demand technologies (e.g., AI, blockchain, cybersecurity), ensuring that students don't just participate\u2014they grow consistently.\n\nInternal Mentorship & Peer Learning: Many juniors are enthusiastic but feel lost due to lack of direction. A structured mentorship program, where experienced club members mentor freshers, will promote retention, upskilling, and stronger team culture.\n\nCollaborations with Startups & Industry: Partnering with startups, alumni, and companies can provide real-world problem statements and visibility to student work, increasing both relevance and motivation.\n\nInterdisciplinary Collaboration: Tech shouldn't function in a silo. By integrating technical clubs with design, business, and cultural domains, we can build more dynamic projects\u2014like hackathons with real-world themes, tech-enabled art installations, or startup pitch events combining coding and creativity.",
      "Select the domains in which you are skilled.": "Web Development (Frontend), Web Development (Backend)",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "To enhance VIT\u2019s participation and success in external events, we need to focus on making students feel more prepared, supported, and motivated. \n\nPre-event Preparation and Peer Learning: Students often struggle to prepare for external events due to lack of resources or direction. I propose organizing informal workshops or peer-led sessions that focus on practical skills\u2014whether it's coding for technical events, choreography for dance, or public speaking for cultural events. Students should have access to the right knowledge and resources well in advance.\n\nTeam Collaboration and Mentorship: External events are all about strong teamwork. We can set up mentorship programs where seniors guide juniors and offer advice on handling competition pressure, improving skills, and creating effective team strategies. This will build a sense of community and ensure better preparedness.\n\nIncreased Institutional Support: Students who participate in external events often do so on their own time and resources. We should push for better support from the university, like travel stipends, practice space, and even dedicated time slots for rehearsals or coding sessions. This would relieve students from the burden of balancing academics and preparation.\n\nEncouraging Participation and Team Selection: Often, students are hesitant to participate in big external events due to fear of competition. We can make the process more inclusive by hosting internal selection rounds that give every interested student the opportunity to showcase their skills. This will create a fair and transparent way to pick teams while building confidence.\n\nPost-event Feedback and Recognition: After every event, we need to ensure that students get feedback on their performance to improve next time. Additionally, we should celebrate all teams, not just the winners, through social media shout-outs, certificates, or small recognition events to keep the motivation high.",

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "I haven't heard many complains regarding academics in VIT but a few complaints regarding mess cleanliness and food standards have been made. There are several feedback forms and other ways to register such complains but the standards do not seem to change drastically to a satisfactory level as expected by the students. The plates and spoon not being clean, appropriate amount of food not being given for snacks, too much rush in the mess causing waste of time while taking food are some prominent complains being made. I think regular inspections of the mess conditions should be made so the voice of the students can be heard and verified and explaining the situations to the caterers in a polite yet firm manner is important. Strict follow ups and actions should be taken to ensure that the problems do not persist as these are very recurring complaints made by the students."

Faculties with experties in the specific field related to the event can guide the students to achieve success. The involvement of the students and there will and hardwork will also help them to achieve greater heights."

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community..1": "I have contributed to VIT in many ways, most being through the Cultural and Technical Fests of VIT namely Riviera and graVITas. Where I played the key role of being the Event and Premium Events Volunteer. I have carried out my duties exceptionally well and was praised for my works as well. I am also serving as the Chairperson of the chapter \"IET-VIT\", where I am taking at most responsibilities to ensure proper movement of the chapter in Events and helping the college learn more from us though my teams guidance.",

I also have the skill to communicate well with others, being a Chairperson of a chapter your words really matter. I ensured whatever I say is never taken in a wrong way and always ensures that it is understood right by the second person or a group. So I would choose these as the area I would contribute effectively.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "I feel the one thing every student wants is to give out is their opinions freely. Being a very large campus with more than 10,000 students, I completely understand its highly unlikely that all of our voices will be heard. But I feel certain responsible staff/faculties should be assigned to this so that the welfare of the students can be ensured. I also feel most of this communication (with the students and the responsible staff) should be kept completely private, as the students are really frightened whether they will receive a backlash due to their completely legitimate opinions.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "To enhance VIT's participation especially during major festivals like Gravitas - The priority should be participation, reducing or waiving entry fees for select events can encourage more external students to attend. Word of mouth will naturally boost interest if participants have a great experience. Initiatives like \"Yantra Central Hack\" have been excellent and should continue, as they add real value and attract genuine talent. Another major attraction for both VIT students and outsiders is the food stalls. However, they should be more diverse having the same cuisine everywhere is disappointing. The food and cultural teams should ensure variety that caters to different tastes and includes rare or unique items that catch attention.\nOn the cultural front, Riviera - ProShows are a major draw. Making these free or at least more affordable for VIT students would be a huge relief, as not everyone can afford expensive tickets. For external participants, small fest games could be organized where winners receive discounted or free ProShow passes. This adds excitement and makes them feel rewarded. Finally, accommodation plays a big role. Offering top quality stays with AC and good food can leave a lasting impression on external visitors and make them more likely to return. If we prioritize comfort, affordability, and unforgettable experiences, Gravitas can truly grow into a festival known across the country."

I\u2019d advocate for a monthly \"Creative Recharge\" session where students can explore non-academic activities in a stress-free environment, guided by their peers or seniors who share similar interests.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "I believe one of the most impactful investments VIT can make is establishing a structured channel to help pass down knowledge and opportunities from senior students to their juniors\u2014a legacy that supports generations of learners.\n\nMany talented students at VIT miss out on life-changing opportunities\u2014not due to a lack of skill, but due to a lack of awareness or access to insider information. Drawing from my own exposure to top-tier international conferences and a strong professional network, I\u2019ve seen that opportunities often accessible to IITians are within reach\u2014but they require strategic preparation, often over a year in advance. Unfortunately, most VIT students remain unaware of such paths until it\u2019s too late.\n\nIn a growing student population, connecting with the right people becomes increasingly difficult. That\u2019s why creating a platform for knowledge transfer is essential. If we truly wish to nurture exceptional students who can build on the work of those before them, rather than starting from scratch, we must create a pipeline for the passing down of experience, guidance, and opportunity.\n\nProposed Advocacy:\n\nEvents:\nThe DSW or relevant institutional bodies can host networking events between pre-final year students and their juniors. A form can be circulated to collect data on the achievements and experiences of senior students\u2014many of whom leave VIT without the chance to give back, simply because such a platform doesn\u2019t exist. Identifying these seniors and connecting them with motivated juniors through events can bridge this gap.\n\nTechnical solutions:\nA dedicated website can serve as a central repository where high-achieving students share their experiences through blogs or articles. This would offer juniors access to insights on research opportunities, internships, higher studies, referrals, and more\u2014across diverse fields. This platform can serve as a channel of legacy, empowering students with practical, experience-driven knowledge to plan their paths more effectively."

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community..1": "I have had the opportunity to contribute to the VIT community through various academic and co-curricular roles. During the academic year 2024\u20132025, I served as the Programme Representative for my branch (MID), where I acted as a bridge between students and faculty. I regularly communicated students\u2019 concerns, suggestions, and feedback to coordinators and the SW Director, striving to ensure a smooth academic experience for my peers.\n\nIn addition, I was a core member of the Bulls & Bears club, where I gained firsthand experience in the functioning of student clubs and contributed to the successful organization of several events aimed at increasing financial literacy and engagement. This experience deepened my understanding of teamwork, event planning, and student outreach.\n\nCurrently, I am a part of the VITMAS club, and I am actively looking forward to contributing to meaningful projects that align with both student interests and academic values.\n\nThese experiences have helped me develop a sense of responsibility, enhanced my interpersonal skills, and strengthened my commitment to serving the VIT community to the best of my ability.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "Over the past few semesters, I have developed strong leadership and problem-solving skills, particularly through working on team-based projects in various course modules. These experiences have taught me how to coordinate effectively within diverse groups, handle challenges calmly, and ensure that everyone's strengths are utilized toward a common goal. I enjoy approaching problems analytically and collaboratively, and I believe this mindset is essential when working on real-world issues.\n\nIn addition to academics, my experience as a Programme Representative has helped me understand the importance of listening to student concerns and ensuring their voices are heard by the faculty and administration. I\u2019ve learned how to convey grievances respectfully and work with higher authorities to find practical solutions that benefit the student community.\n\nI believe my skills can be most effectively used in handling grievances, fostering student-faculty communication, encouraging collaboration among clubs, and increasing overall student engagement. Beyond these responsibilities, I have a deeper vision for the campus.\n\nIt is my dream to help make VIT a smarter, more inclusive, and innovation-driven campus. I want to encourage more students to participate in real-world problem-solving and hands-on projects that can directly contribute to improving our campus environment\u2014academically, technologically, and socially. With the collective potential of our student body, I believe we can implement creative solutions and technological advancements that truly transform the way we learn, live, and grow here at VIT.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One change that students often hope for\u2014but which tends to be overlooked\u2014is the need for more meaningful, inclusive, and growth-oriented learning opportunities beyond just academics or event management.\n\nFrom my experience, most student clubs in VIT focus heavily on organizing events and maintaining publicity. While these efforts are important for visibility and engagement, they often leave limited scope for building impactful projects or nurturing peer learning. Due to time constraints, tight event deadlines, and demanding class hours, clubs tend to collaborate within familiar circles instead of investing time in onboarding and mentoring new students. This unintentionally limits peer upliftment and hinders many students from realizing their full potential.\n\nMoreover, while the academic structure at VIT has strong potential, I feel it is currently more aligned with marks and examinations than deep, meaningful learning. If teaching were approached with the goal of fostering curiosity, creativity, and problem-solving\u2014not just grades\u2014it could truly transform the way students engage with academics.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for creating a culture where students are encouraged and supported to solve real, challenging, and creative problems within the campus. For example:\n\nBuilding accessible tech for students with disabilities, such as assistive navigation tools.\n\nAutomating campus-wide sustainability efforts, like smart water management in hostels or eco-feedback systems for mess food wastage.\n\nDesigning modular learning tools that help students master subjects at their own pace, with peer-generated content or simulations.\n\nI believe every student is unique\u2014some perform best in competitive, fast-paced environments, while others thrive when given freedom to explore and create without pressure. Both types of students have immense value to offer. That\u2019s why we need diverse platforms and mentorship models that allow all students to shine in their own way\u2014be it through competitions, hands-on innovations, or thoughtful campus contributions.\n\nAs a member secretary, I would work to bring these overlooked needs into the spotlight, ensuring that the Student Council becomes a platform not just for representation, but also for transformation.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "The Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters at VIT has immense potential, but to achieve greater impact, it needs to move beyond isolated events and surface-level learning. In my opinion, the focus should shift toward continuous skill development, real-world application, and inclusive mentorship.\n\nFirstly, most technical clubs currently concentrate on hosting workshops, hackathons, or competitions\u2014while these are valuable, their impact tends to be short-term and often benefits only a core group of already-skilled students. To expand reach, clubs should adopt a project-based mentorship model, where beginners are paired with experienced members to work on long-term, real-world campus or community problems. This fosters both learning and a sense of contribution.\n\nSecondly, collaboration between clubs is still limited. Many clubs work in silos, despite sharing overlapping goals. We can encourage inter-club initiatives\u2014for example, a hardware and software club coming together to build a smart recycling system for the campus. Such collaborations can spark innovation and also teach students how to work in diverse, interdisciplinary teams, just like in the real world.\n\nThird, we need to ensure that club efforts align with campus improvement and student well-being. If technical clubs channel their creativity toward building tools like mental health support bots, anonymous feedback systems, or smart utilities for hostels, it can create meaningful visibility, encourage more student participation, and even get support from administration.\n\nLastly, inclusivity is key. Not every technically inclined student is a competitive coder or someone who can speak well in meetings. Some are thinkers, quiet doers, or passionate learners. We need to design technical clubs to be safe spaces for learning, experimenting, and failing without judgment. Structured onboarding sessions, beginner tracks, and open project participation can ensure everyone finds their space to grow.\n\nIn short, the technical sector should evolve into a vibrant ecosystem\u2014one that not only hones technical excellence, but also fuels collaboration, campus impact, and student empowerment.",

Additionally, I proposed the idea of introducing a varsity jacket for the student council, which was well-received as a symbol of unity and representation.",

I have well-developed public speaking and communication skills that help me convey ideas clearly, motivate my team, and ensure alignment towards shared goals. These skills also foster strong interpersonal relationships, building trust and collaboration\u2014both of which are essential for smooth event execution.\n\nIn addition to leadership, I bring creativity in designing event-related materials such as merchandise, posters, and digital content, which enhance event branding and outreach. I am also organized, detail-oriented, and capable of multitasking under pressure, allowing me to handle complex responsibilities in fast-paced environments.\n\nHaving lived in both Dubai and Goa\u2014regions known for their rich cultural diversity\u2014I have developed a deep appreciation and understanding of different cultures.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One change many VIT students genuinely hope for\u2014but that often gets overlooked\u2014is more flexibility and clarity in the course registration and elective selection process. It can be frustrating when seats fill up too quickly, prerequisites aren\u2019t clearly communicated, or schedules clash\u2014especially when students are trying to plan their academics thoughtfully.\n\nIf given the chance, I\u2019d advocate for a more student-friendly approach by regularly gathering feedback about the registration experience and sharing it with the academic coordinators. I\u2019d also push for earlier access to elective details and faculty information, so students can make more informed choices. A real-time platform showing available slots could go a long way in reducing stress and making the process smoother. These small but meaningful changes could really improve students\u2019 academic journeys.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "I think VIT has a lot of talent and potential, but sometimes it just needs a bit more structure and support to shine on bigger platforms. One way to enhance participation in external events is by building more awareness\u2014many students don\u2019t even hear about opportunities until it\u2019s too late. Regular updates through official channels and dedicated mentorship for teams can make a big difference.\n\nAlso, logistical support\u2014like easing attendance for participants, providing travel aid, or even helping with resources for preparation\u2014can boost both participation and performance. When students feel backed by their institution, they\u2019re more confident and motivated to represent VIT and do their best.",

Because they are not aware of the wide range of career options available, many students I have spoken to are uncertain about their future. Without fully comprehending the options or what best suits them, they frequently wind up selecting paths just because their peers did. I would support frequent alumni gatherings with professionals from a variety of fields in order to address this. These discussions might centre on how career paths have changed over time and what abilities or attitudes are currently in demand. Since students can relate more to those who were once in their position, hearing firsthand accounts and perspectives from alumni would have a greater impact than traditional counselling. This",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "In my opinion VIT can enhance its participation and success in external events by encouraging collaboration between different cultural clubs to share skills and resources. Also we can provide expert workshops and alumni contacts for guidance and skill development.We can organize frequent internal events to help clubs improve their performances and build confidence. We can give them permission for re-exams or permission for leaving classes during the period of important competitions. Also in some cases it is not possible for some students to arrange for their travel and accommodation. In this case we can help the team with their travel and accommodation expenses. These are some ways by which we can increase participation and success of VIT in external events.\nI have seen that in internal events of VIT, we can increase external participation of students by providing them accommodation. While I talked to students of other college, stay was main problem they were facing. So we can collaborate with hotels if possible and increase the external participation in the internal events as well."

As the Student Council, we can send out questionnaires asking if they have any issues with proceedings of the university, or can set up a small stand to facilitate communication between the students and the Council in the comfort and safety of their academic blocks. Students can also be frequently updated on the improvements brought about by the Council so they feel heard."

If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "Although VIT has great placement cells and career services dedicated to that purpose, students who feel lost and can't always reach out to CDC for help or the fear of being judged and often crave real, relatable advice from peers who recently navigated their way through internships, research projects or job applications- especially for niche roles or emerging fields like fintech, Gen AI, Prompt engineering etc. The gap isn't always in availability of resources but in aproachability and practical up-to-date guidance. \nTo advocate for this, I would like to propose an idea of a student-driven platform under the student council body- the Peer Career Network(PCN) for students to mentor each other about placements, internships, higher studies applications and skill developments- across all departments. We know students from VIT has a wide band in different career paths, for instance if anyone's interested in appearing for UPSC and has got no clarity about the competitive exams and how to prepare, this platform could find an alumni who cracked UPSC and is a successful IAS or IPS and we can connect that guy to this alumni and this could help this guy a lot because we learn a lot from other people's experience who has been on the same path before. Another instance, where any of our alumni work in boeing and he can put a referral for one of our student who has the potential and required skill set to work there too but cant get through due to the crowded job market. We can maintain a student-updated opportunity channel, conduct placement drives, career map seminars and panels.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "Students can grow their technical skills and expand their skill set working in teams under clubs and chapters applying their knowledge to solve actual problems faced by people in need- whether it's rural communities, small businesses, NGOs or disadvantaged groups. And when clubs work on such meaningful, real world challenges, students feel more motivated, gain hands-on deployment experience, and VIT builds a reputation as a socially responsible and innovative campus. For example, Electronics and IoT clubs can work together to develop an affordable water-level monitoring systems to prevent water wastage in nearby rural areas. Machine learning enthusiasts can create crop disease detection apps for farmers in nearby villages. Coding and app development clubs can build digital literacy apps or e-learning platforms for under-resourced schools in the region.",
      "Select the domains in which you are skilled.": "Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "In my opinion, VIT can enhance its participation and success in external events by ensuring that all students feel included, supported and valued when they represent the university. I believe that a lot of students are unaware, hesitate to particpate, or lack clarity on how to start. To solve this problem, we can conduct orientation sessions where students can explore teams, clubs and chapters that match their area of skills and interests. Setting up preparation groups and peer mentorship can also help a lot in this case where we can connect experienced participants with newcomers and they can motivate them to participate by sharing their experience so that the newcomers even though with no prior exposure feel confident and guided. We can motivate the students not just in terms of prizes, but also skill building. networking, exposure and personal growth. Organizing post-event recognitions where participants share their learnings and achievements publicly which also shows that the university truly values their effort and motivates more student to move forward."

I\u2019d also suggest integrating these maps into the student app or portal for easier digital access.

I am an active member of the Bulls & Bears Finance Club, where I helped drive initiatives aimed at enhancing financial literacy and market awareness among students. During Yantra Week, I served as a mentor for the flagship event Dalal Street, guiding participants through real-time trading simulations and helping them understand core concepts of stock market dynamics and strategic decision-making. In addition to my finance-oriented involvement, I successfully cracked the interviews for both the Management and the Publicity & Management domains of the IEEE Computer Society. Through these roles, I actively collaborate on planning, logistics, and outreach for large-scale technical events, leveraging communication and organizational skills to create high-impact student experiences. My goal is to continue contributing to VIT\u2019s vibrant student culture while honing my leadership and managerial acumen.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "I possess excellent English communication skills, both verbal and written, which have consistently supported my leadership roles and collaborative efforts across various student organizations at VIT Vellore.

My involvement in the Bulls & Bears Finance Club, where I mentored students during the Dalal Street event at Yantra Week, has allowed me to blend financial knowledge with public speaking and mentoring. Additionally, cracking the interviews for both the Management and Publicity domains of IEEE CS has enabled me to actively contribute to event execution, outreach, and student engagement initiatives. I believe my strongest contributions lie in communication-driven roles\u2014whether it\u2019s managing teams, mentoring peers, or leading publicity efforts\u2014where I can effectively bridge ideas, people, and execution to create meaningful impact.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One change that students often desire\u2014but is frequently overlooked\u2014is greater practical exposure and inter-club collaboration, especially across non-technical and technical domains. Many students feel siloed within their respective clubs or domains, limiting cross-learning opportunities. If given the opportunity, I would advocate for structured interdisciplinary initiatives, such as joint workshops, simulation events, and collaborative competitions that blend finance, tech, management, and creativity. By leveraging my experience in both finance (Bulls & Bears Club) and management/publicity (IEEE CS), I would work to create platforms where clubs can co-host events, share resources, and reach wider student groups. This not only fosters holistic learning but also builds a stronger, more interconnected campus community where students feel seen and empowered beyond their immediate circles",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT can enhance participation and success in external events by creating a centralized platform to share upcoming competitions, offering mentorship from experienced faculty or seniors, and allocating dedicated funding or resources to support promising teams. Additionally, promoting inter-club and interdisciplinary collaboration can help form diverse, well-rounded teams with a mix of technical, management, and communication skills\u2014greatly improving the chances of success on external stages. Regular workshops, mock events, and recognition of achievers can further boost motivation and preparedness."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "There is not one but a handful of changes or improvements that students want but are often overlooked like delivery pick-up point being far away, lack of proper football field, waste segregation etc. but the most overlooked among these according to me is the lack of proper transportation for hostellers from hostel to college. The shuttle service is 20 rupees and not reliable whereas the autorickshaw ride can take up to 200 rupees per trip. I would advocate for a subsidised or institution supported electrical shuttle system, like mini golf karts, which run on a fixed schedule according to ffcs slots, which would be cheaper if not free and could be included in the hostel fees \nIn general to handle any problem, I would identify it by running a monthly student survey and provide respective campus authorities the relevant data, share it with my higher ups, and consult them regarding any changes I would like to suggest. In any case I would discuss any issue with my peers as well before escalating it because it is always a good idea and helps to not only establish a good relationship with them but also peer review is unbiased and helps find flaws in your suggestion or idea."

I know there are though but frequently will furthermore rise the number of participants and decrease in these kind of individual doubts about themselves.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "To increase participation and success in external events we need to incorporate various informed sessions as there are emails regarding the events that can be participated but majority of time they are overlooked and the participation rate goes down many talented student do not see it and the rate goes down, so to enhance the rate and success we need to enthusiastically organise information sessions in various various auditoriums so that studemts from where ever they are can come and see the opportunity and encourage them to participate, being excellent in academics is one thing but extracurricular is different taste, so we should encourage participation by the help of various clubs and chapters and therefore more successwe be incoming."

As an active member of the Student Council 2024\u201325, I played a key role in coordinating and supporting various initiatives across departments. I had the opportunity to work as a coordinator in Gravitas\u201924 and as a volunteer in Riviera\u201924, both under the RnR (Registration and Reception) domain. These experiences allowed me to interact with a diverse set of students, help manage large-scale events, and ensure smooth execution from the backend.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

Whether it's about exam schedules, form submission deadlines, course registration procedures, or hostel rules, students often waste a lot of time searching across outdated websites, contacting busy faculty, or relying on hearsay from peers. This results in confusion, missed deadlines, and unnecessary stress\u2014especially for first-year or newly transferred students.\n\nA simple yet innovative solution would be to implement a college-specific AI-based chatbot or virtual assistant. This chatbot could be integrated into the institution\u2019s app or website, and trained to handle frequently asked questions about academics, campus facilities, rules, placements, and even club activities. It would serve as a real-time, accessible knowledge base for students."

If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One thing a lot of students wish for, but often gets overlooked\u2014is an easy way to find chances to get involved. There is a lot of clubs and events happening, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to actually know where help is needed or what you can be a part of, especially if you\u2019re not already in the loop.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I\u2019d push for something simple- maybe something like a space where students, organizers or even faculties can regularly share things they need help with, whether it's just designing a poster, managing an event, or even contributing to a project. That way, anyone who's free or interested can just jump in and help out. This would be a great way to make the campus feel way more connected and open, especially for students who want to contribute but don\u2019t really know where to start.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "To improve VIT\u2019s participation and performance in external events, I think we need to focus on three main things: early communication, smoother coordination, and consistent support.\n\nFirst, students should hear about upcoming external events well in advance so they have enough time to prepare properly. Second, there should be better coordination between clubs, faculty, and the committee to speed things up like permissions, venue bookings, and other arrangements. Finally, having a small team help with things like travel, documentation, and follow-ups would really take the pressure off everyone and let them focus fully on performing their best.",

My experience in the Fifth Pillar Club further sharpened my organizational abilities and taught me how to work closely with diverse teams to execute events smoothly.\n\nI believe I can contribute most effectively in the area of student outreach and coordination.

Many students feel unheard when it comes to everyday concerns like time clashes, project approvals, or updates on curriculum changes.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for a centralized communication platform or monthly open forums where students can raise concerns directly with council members and relevant faculty representatives.

      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "The Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters can be expanded by encouraging collaboration between clubs, promoting interdisciplinary projects, and making technical resources more accessible to all students. Many students are interested in tech but don\u2019t know where to start\u2014so hosting introductory bootcamps, mentorship programs, and open workshops can make technical learning more inclusive.\n\nAdditionally, creating a shared platform for clubs to publish tutorials, project ideas, and event recordings would ensure knowledge is preserved and widely available.

      "Select the domains in which you are skilled.": "Web Development (Frontend), Web Development (Backend), Full Stack Development",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "To enhance VIT's participation and success in external events, it\u2019s important to focus on early identification of talent, consistent training, and strong logistical support. Many skilled students are willing to represent VIT but often lack the platform or encouragement to do so.\n\nVIT can organize internal competitions, auditions, and workshops to discover and prepare participants across cultural, technical, and sports domains. Additionally, maintaining a calendar of external events, offering funding and travel assistance, and appointing faculty or alumni mentors for guidance would significantly boost performance and confidence.\n\nBuilding a strong support system around passionate students will not only increase participation but also help VIT shine at the national and international level."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "In my views, students seek for more industry based learning and exposure. While VIT holds a strong academic and cultural foundations but gap between students and industries could be sensed. This could be facilitated by encouraging guest talks, workshops, and exposure to real-time applications of what we learn in class. Every month, industry academia workshops and sessions could be arranged to keep students advanced with new technologies and fundamentals in the industries. Moreover, expert talks and problem solving challenges in collaboration with companies would guide and expose students with a more practical and relevant industry learnings.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "For doing so, first of all we have to figure out the hidden talents among the students which could be facilitated by conducting timely open auditions and showcases. This would help in creating a central cultural talent pool which could be efficient to direct in terms of mentorships, enhancements and supporting aids. Students should be made aware of upcoming opportunities through efficient technical systems such as an app to keep track for all VIT and external events for early preparation and better representation. Collaboration with industries and alumni or cultural organizations outside VIT could also help students excel success and participation in external events."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

With so many departments and officials, it can be hard to reach the right person, leading to frustration and confusion. To address this, I\u2019d advocate for a centralized platform where students can easily find contact information for the right department based on their issue. This platform could include a searchable database for categories like academics, hostels, and events, along with a ticketing system to streamline communication.\n\nAnother common concern is the lack of clear and consistent communication about academic schedules, assessments, and deadlines.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "Hostel Shifting Concern:\nOne issue that\u2019s often overlooked is the stress girls face during hostel shifting, from GHJ block who are suddenly asked to move to distant buildings like the Power House. The process is tiring and emotionally draining, especially when only 1 or 2 trolleys are available for so many students. Managing heavy luggage over long distances without enough logistical support creates unnecessary chaos and affects our well-being. If given a chance, I\u2019d strongly advocate for better planning, more trolleys, and a smoother, more supportive shifting process.\n\nShuttle Facilities:\nWhile VIT does provide shuttle services, there\u2019s definitely room for improvement. During peak hours or when students need to reach distant locations like SJT PRP or academic blocks from far hostels (GHJ block ladies hostel) , the frequency and availability of shuttles often fall short. Many students are left waiting or end up walking long distances in the heat or rain or taking expensive auto services.I would propose better scheduling of shuttles, especially during exam periods, to make campus movement easier and more efficient for everyone."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One significant change that students often seek but is frequently overlooked is the need for a more structured and accessible mentorship program. Many students struggle to find guidance on career paths, technical skills, and industry insights, leading to uncertainty in their professional development. If given the opportunity, I would advocate for a centralized mentorship platform where students can connect with experienced peers, alumni, and industry professionals. This platform would include scheduled mentorship sessions, resource sharing, and discussion forums to facilitate meaningful interactions. By integrating AI-driven recommendations, students could be matched with mentors based on their interests and career aspirations. Additionally, organizing regular workshops and networking events would further strengthen the mentorship ecosystem. Through this initiative, students would gain valuable insights, build confidence, and make informed decisions about their future, ultimately bridging the gap between academic learning and real-world applications."

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community..1": "Over the last two years, I\u2019ve tried to be an active part of the VIT community, in the first semester i wasn't aware of so many things but In the second year I started participating in events organised by VIT clubs and chapters, won Yantra in the first year.In the second year I was junior core of AIChE( American institute of chemical engineers) I represented AIChE VIT in student regional conference (SRC) held at NIT Rourkela. \nAlso I was a volunteer of the halls and management committee in Gravitas 2024 . In the 4th semester I was a student ambassador for Chemathon 6.0 organised by AIChE(American Institute of Chemical Engineers ) VIT, also i became Co-secretary of SESI (Solar energy society of India), PoC of yantra : the elemental fourfold forge, volunteer of halls and management committee in Riviera 2025 , also I was the PoC of quality circle week (the comic muse) and Organiser of Bidathon.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "I have developed a few skills by participating,volunteering and organising events.

Through roles such as Co-Secretary of SESI (Solar Energy Society of India), PoC of Yantra and Quality Circle Week, organiser of Bidathon, student ambassador of chemathon 6.0 and volunteer of Gravitas 2024 and Riviera 2025 I have strengthened my ability to coordinate large teams, manage logistics, and execute successful events.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "I see reimbursement as one such issue because there are high ratio of students who are not reimbursed for the money they have spent. To overcome this I would create awareness about this by mailing about the reimbursement procedure and eligibility.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "Many of external events are during CATs and FATs so students do not want to miss their exams even though they can get re-exams, it is because there if high chance of re cars being not approved. \nAlso students are not reimbursed for their travel, students are spending money in registration, accomodation,food and travel apart from this they also have to spend on experiments (in case of technical events), so atleast if part of this is reimbursed then there is high chance of student participating in externals events."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

If given the opportunity, I would advocate for a system that recognizes and accommodates productive engagements outside the classroom. I\u2019d work with student councils and faculty to propose a transparent policy that balances academic commitment with holistic development.\nMoreover I belive,course and elective registration (FFCS) can be chaotic and frustrating for many students. I would suggest implementing a more transparent and fair allotment system, perhaps using student feedback and demand-based slotting, and work with academic affairs to improve."

My goal is to ensure every student feels represented and valued",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "A change students often want but is overlooked is better mental health support and academic flexibility during stressful times. Many students hesitate to seek help or aren\u2019t fully aware of the resources available. If elected, I\u2019d advocate for more awareness campaigns on mental wellness and push for academic relief, like deadline extensions or wellness days, especially during exams. It\u2019s about making students feel supported and heard when they need it most.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT has incredible talent, but to shine more in external events, we need stronger preparation, visibility, and support. I believe we can enhance participation by organizing internal bootcamps, mock competitions, and mentorship from seniors or alumni who've excelled outside. Promoting a culture of collaboration between clubs can also raise performance standards. If selected, I\u2019d focus on building a structured system that identifies talent early, prepares them thoroughly, and showcases VIT\u2019s cultural strength across platforms. It\u2019s time we move from participation to domination."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One key change that students strongly desire but often goes overlooked is the need for decentralized and accessible communication with faculty and administration. Many students face confusion when trying to find the right person to approach for help or guidance. Creating a decentralized system where any faculty or staff member can provide basic support, or implementing a centralized AI-powered chatbot, like VIT\u2019s own version of ChatGPT can significantly reduce this burden while ensuring faster and more consistent communication. Additionally, the academic calendar often clashes with major hackathons and events, making it difficult for students to balance academics with valuable practical experiences. I would advocate for a more flexible and inclusive academic structure that allocates proper buffer periods around key events, allowing students to learn, innovate, and still manage their coursework effectively. These changes can greatly enhance student well-being, productivity, and engagement\u2014ensuring that learning at VIT remains both structured and enriching."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "1. Hostel Shifting Stress:\nOne major concern for students is the stress caused by sudden or frequent hostel shifting. It disrupts daily routines, creates emotional discomfort, and affects academic focus. If given the opportunity, I would advocate for more transparent communication, planned schedules, and support systems to make the transition smoother and less stressful.\n\n2. Academic Pressure:\nMany students also struggle with academic stress due to tight deadlines, back-to-back exams, and lack of breaks. I would work to promote better academic planning, regular feedback sessions, and wellness activities to help students manage their workload and mental well-being more effectively."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "The main improvement that students want to see is proper venue allocation and crowd control. Although we have plenty of space in foody areas, it is very difficult to conduct and accommodate many students, especially boys, so I have an idea of drafting an event memo that must be sent through the mails so that they can't miss the data. Although club events are posted on their Instagram handles. the\u00a0CDC events and freshers counseling events and etc ,\u00a0data is not reaching all of the students."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

They often want hands-on exposure\u2014through mini-projects, industry-relevant challenges, or peer-led builds\u2014but the curriculum and events occasionally aren't able to support them.\n\nMy Proposal:\nI\u2019d initiate a \u201cBuild-It Week\u201d\u2014a casual, low-pressure series where students from all branches team up to solve small, practical problems (like building a smart attendance system or redesigning a college app UI). No competition\u2014just building, learning, and showcasing.

      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "In my opinion, the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters can achieve greater impact by shifting from isolated activities to a more ecosystem-driven, interdisciplinary approach like ,\n1) Unified Tech Calendar Across Clubs:\nCreate a common calendar where tech-related events (workshops, hackathons, sessions) are coordinated across clubs to avoid overlap and encourage participation from multiple domains\u2014AI, hardware, design, etc.\n2) Problem-Driven Collaboration:\nEncourage clubs to co-host events around real-world problems. This creates relevance and pushes students to apply tech meaningfully.\n3) Internal Open-Source Projects:\nLaunch college-wide open-source initiatives where students can contribute to building tools for the campus (attendance bots, resource portals, etc.).\n\nBy integrating these ideas, the Technical Sector won\u2019t just host events\u2014it will nurture a living, evolving tech culture that support student growth and drive tangible innovation.",

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community..1": "In my first year at VIT, I tried to actively contribute to the community by engaging myself in both academic and extracurricular activities.I tried my level best to positively engage within the campus life as an active participant in events including Gravitas, Rivera , Yantra and various worships conducted by clubs and chapters . It has been a way for me to interact with varying groups of students, ensure collaboration and build a healthy and diverse campus life.\n\nAikya was especially an experience to remember. I was privileged to represent the lovely state of Uttarakhand, and being able to share its distinct traditions and heritage was a rich and vibrant experience. Being among students from different states reinforced my respect for India's cultural diversity and reinforced my conviction in the unity in diversity spirit that VIT promotes.\n\nBeyond cultural involvement, I also enhanced my technical acumen through active participation in various workshops hosted by clubs and chapters like ACM and IEEE WIE.\n\nI also secured third place in Relayathon, a hackathon held during Yantra 2025 at VIT, Vellore.\n\nThese platforms provided me with opportunities to explore cutting-edge technologies such as training AI models to detect and prevent deepfakes and working for real-world applications. These hands-on experiences not only strengthened my problem-solving skills but also sparked a deeper interest in ethical and impactful innovation. As a first year with limited knowledge in this domain , these workshops really helped me gain meaningful insights on these topics and helped me broaden my horizon.\n\nMotivated by these experiences, I hope to give back even more significantly to the VIT community. I look forward to assuming more leadership positions, starting inclusive and effective projects that promote unity, diversity and harmony.My vision is to develop lasting platforms that promote creativity, foster diversity and make the VIT community even stronger.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "I have always been passionate about leadership, problem-solving and bringing teams together to achieve common goals. I believe in a fact-based, analytical, and logical approach to challenges, with a style grounded in hard work, self-reliance and perfectionism. Beyond academics, I am passionate about debating, classical dancing, singing, baking, swimming and UI/UX design. These interests have taught me discipline and time management, while keeping me creatively engaged. I am also deeply interested in politics and love exploring political systems and current affairs, which helps me sharpen my critical thinking and stay socially aware.\nI would describe myself as responsible, adaptable and always ready to take on new challenges with a positive and team-oriented mindset. To sum it up, I am a determined and persistent learner and I love to work until by goal is reached.\n\nI can effectively contribute in the management domain because I have a strong passion for leadership and problem-solving. I enjoy coordinating teams, making strategic decisions and ensuring projects move smoothly towards their goals. During my previous experiences as a student council member in my school , I realised that my strengths lie in effective communication, decision-making and motivating teams to achieve targets.\n\nMoreover, I also have a keen interest in UI/UX designing and I have completed the Google UX Design Professional Certificate on Coursera and worked on two projects\u2014a mobile app design and a website design using various applications like Figma , Adobe XD and Canva . \n\nI believe that my ability to understand both the technical and interpersonal aspects of management makes the culture and the digital domain a perfect fit for me .",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "Personally in my first year ,I felt that one of the most frequently overlooked student needs is early and sustained exposure to genuine industry experience and mentorship. Although internships are later on, students fail to have a direction especially in the first year.\n\nIf provided with the chance, I would promote formal mentorship schemes with industry experts and alumni, incorporate micro-industry projects into courses, and conduct hands-on Bootcamps in collaboration with organizations such as IEEE . This would close the gap between academia and industry, enabling students to make well-informed and confident career decisions right from the beginning. This would provide the first years with an early kickstart to gain knowledge and become technically sound by the fourth year.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "In my opinion by simplifying approval procedures, offering travel and logistics assistance and rewarding accomplishments through credits or incentives along with proper promotions of the events will enhance morale and the participation of students .\n\nAn action group led by student council could be used to monitor themes, trends and types of future external fests. This would allow teams to align performances strategically to ensure both freshness and applicability.\nMoreover , having mentoring sessions with exceptional alumni and cultural professionals would serve as short-term mentors as it would introduce students to practical artistry, stagecraft and competition tactics which would close the distance hindering between the campus creativity and national platforms.",

Additionally, I am part of the Entrepreneurship Cell, one of VIT's elite clubs, where I played a role in organizing impactful events that brought together industry leaders and aspiring entrepreneurs, fostering a culture of innovation and leadership on campus",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "My experiences as a volunteer for Riviera and as a member of the Entrepreneurship Cell\u2014particularly in the Technical Department\u2014have helped me develop strong skills in leadership, communication, teamwork, and technical coordination. Through working on the technical execution of events, I\u2019ve learned to handle responsibilities efficiently and adapt quickly under pressure. I believe I can contribute most effectively in event planning, technical support, and student engagement, where a combination of organizational and technical skills is crucial",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One important yet often overlooked concern among students is the lack of transparency in soft skills examinations. Many students are unclear about the evaluation process, marking criteria, and feedback, which leads to confusion and a lack of direction for improvement. Another common concern is the restriction on visiting friends in other hostels, which limits healthy social interaction and collaboration among peers, especially for group projects and club activities.\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for clear communication from the soft skills department regarding exam formats, assessment rubrics, and feedback mechanisms. Additionally, I would propose a well-regulated system that allows inter-hostel visitation during specified hours, promoting a more connected and collaborative campus environment while maintaining security protocols.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "If selected as Member Secretary \u2013 Technical, I would work to expand the technical sector by encouraging more collaboration between clubs. This includes organizing inter-club hackathons and joint events like workshops and tech talks to increase engagement and knowledge sharing. I would also push for better support for real-life value projects through mentorship and resources, so students can build things that have real-world impact. These steps can make the technical community more active, innovative, and meaningful.",

As someone who came from Bengal to study here in Tamil Nadu, I know what it\u2019s like to step out of your comfort zone\u2014and how much it means to have support when you do.\n\nI think the first step is really seeing the talent around us. VIT is full of incredibly creative people, and sometimes all it takes is the right platform to help them shine. I\u2019d organize fun, low-pressure events within campus to spot emerging performers and then help them grow through training, mentorship, and encouragement. It's not just about winning\u2014it's about building confidence.\n\nI\u2019d also love to connect our students with cultural teams from other colleges, maybe even organize friendly collaborations where we can learn from one another. When we support and push each other creatively, everyone grows. Recognition matters too\u2014whether it\u2019s a shoutout on campus pages, certificates, or just celebrating our teams the way we do for sports or academics. Every artist deserves to feel valued.\n\nI\u2019d try to bring in alumni and professionals who\u2019ve been in our shoes, who can guide us from experience. And most importantly, I\u2019d make sure the process of participating in external events\u2014getting approvals, arranging travel, managing funds\u2014feels easy and smooth, not like a hurdle.\n\nAt the heart of it, I just want our students to feel proud of representing VIT\u2014and to know that when they do, their college stands behind them fully."

As compared to the timings nowadays, it was previously at 11 pm and such during the weekends. Our college has students participating in a number of activities and as such, the amount of time spent for this might vary significantly. A later curfew might enable students to not finish their tasks with significant pressure over their shoulders, rather take an appropriate amount of time to yield the best results.\nOne cannot assume that all students work better during the day and as such, a slightly delayed curfew might help them to be more productive, especially those who might feel that they become more active at night.\nThe size of the campus, along with its greenery make it a remarkable experience at night, and can significantly improve mental health and well being."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

I\u2019d also push for a more balanced academic calendar with breaks that actually help students recharge. It's important to create a campus culture where taking care of your mind is seen as just as important as scoring marks.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT can enhance its participation and success in external events by building a stronger culture of collaboration and internal exposure first. Often, students have talent but don\u2019t get the chance to polish their skills or even hear about external opportunities in time.\n\nOne way to address this is by hosting more intra-college mini-competitions, mock hackathons, paper presentation trials, and pitch practice sessions that simulate real events. These can act as training grounds and help identify students who are ready for larger platforms. We can also create a cross-club task force to track external events, form teams, and share resources like past winning entries, guides, and mentorship contacts.\n\nWhen students feel prepared and supported as part of a team, they are more likely to step up and win at external platforms."

During the Riviera'25, I got a chance to represent my native state -Tripura. Under the name of Northeast state, we showcased our diverse less known culture before the whole VIT community. During the Bengali New Year event conducted by the Bengali Literacy Club, I got a chance to display my art, showcased about the arts and culture of Bengal. Recently, during the CAT 2 time, there were few incidents in our mess which strictly disobey the Rules and Regulations set by the Men's hostel authority. So I took the initiative and inquired about the problem from the Mess Manger. Few days passed, same incident was being repeated. Me along with a bunch of boys wrote emails and letter to warden sir.

Skills where I find myself best is administration, leadership and management. From my schools days I was keen to plan any event, take upon responsibilities, manage it and turn a idea into reality. I love to take up responsibilities, challenges and criticism. I feel, I'm capable to take leadership position and lead the team to success. Any work or any event thrown towards me would be treated with honesty and professionalism. Hoping to work along and contribute as a part of student council.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One thing I personally noticed, was the Hostel counselling and room shifting. Students from weaker section with a poor rank faces issue in getting a room at lower rank (normally students are more likely to take 4,6 bed room as compared to 1,2 bed rooms). Moreover counselling on CGPA basis makes the environment competitive and toxic for slow learning students. Room shifting, packing, keeping all goods, receiving them and settling in a new room ask for a lot of labor and time. Things gets even worse when the timings doesn't matches with student's time of departure. If I'm given the opportunity, my suggestion would be removing counselling rule or we can have reservation system. In the reservation system, we can breakdown any year's batch further into several groups on rank basis. Like Grp 1 has 1-500 rank, Grp 2 has 501-1000 and so on. We can now distribute types of room and there quantity, so that even a lower rank student can afford a minimal priced room.",

This committee can look upon new innovative ways of making tech more reachable to the mass students. Inter-club competition can be held by this committee.

In the cultural aspect, to increase success in external events we can make a Central Events Body headed by our Student Welfare officials, consisting of members of student council and heads of different cultural clubs. This body can look upon selecting individuals from intra-campus events by careful scrutinization and observation. Then we can collab with other renowned cultural clubs of our campus and make a team.

      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "My view is that VIT can significantly improve its participation and success in external events by embracing a better-defined, student-centered policy. To begin with, developing a central pool of talent based on skills and interests can enable early identification and preparation of participants. To assist this must be the regular conduct of workshops, mock events, and guidance from seniors or alumni for confidence and performance improvement. It is important to communicate, and thus a specific External Events Cell or portal can facilitate opportunity sharing and coordination. Acknowledging achievers by certificates, social media recognition, or scholarship incentives would also encourage broader participation. Further, encouraging internal clubs to represent VIT at national events with some allotted budgets and institutional backing can make us heard louder. Lastly, an even smoother pre-event support mechanism for documentation, sponsorships, and permissions will diminish friction and incentivize students to participate more enthusiastically. If selected as Cultural Member Secretary, I would personally take it upon myself to make these ideas a reality and get VIT not just participate but dominate on every outside platform."

Not everyone wants to compete; some just want to participate. If given the opportunity, I\u2019d advocate for more inclusive events\u2014open mics, theme nights, or club collabs\u2014that encourage wider participation.

      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "If I were Member Secretary - Cultural, one of the first things I would do is to better inform students of possible external event opportunities. Too many are unaware that they exist or how to participate. We can correct this by getting appropriate publicity out there and having a proper selection or nomination process. And also creating a better setting\u2014like helping prepare or helping get through it\u2014can be confidence-builders. So then more students will want to do it and will feel ready to give their best, too."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One significant change that students desire but it is often overlooked is the needs to upskill them by fostering their creativity and providing them with industry level exposure within the campus environment. To fill this wide gap, I propose following solutions\nUnified Project Database:\nClubs and Chapters can team up together and build a unified interface where all the past year projects of students can be stored and open sourced so as the current students can access them, learn from them and also contribute by enhancing the working of the project making it more useful and practically applicable.\nWide-Scale Inter-Chapter Collaboration:\nIn this, same chapters from different universities can encourage and facilitate joint events, workshops etc. which can help students learn from new environments, meet new personalities and network among students and mentors from different universities.\nNo Device Zones:\nIntroduce designated areas across campus and organize events. These spaces would prohibit usage of devices and allowance of bags which will help them focus on face to face communication, teamwork exercises and creative brainstorming. Such environments would help students enhance their confidence, relationship building and networking skills and ability to express their ideas and views without distractions or hesitation.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "In my opinion, the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters must go beyond its limits and reach out for interdisciplinary opportunities by collaborating with non-technical clubs which will boost creative thinking and new field exploration for the students as it will be a new open field for them to work on which will boost their creativity, grip on both the technical as well as non-technical aspects benefiting both the sectors. Furthermore, on collaborating agencies for real world projects or launching community based service projects can help expand our work field for non profit purpose as well. Moreover, inserting latest technological trends in VIT community such as ML integration in the Gravitas and Riviera websites for enhanced user experience and best events suggestions can also enhance the student as well as the organizer experience.",

Vellore's hot climate renders full length clothing uncomfortable for everyday movement and casual activities. Permitting shorts outside classrooms such as in hostels, cafeterias, and open areas facilitates student comfort, health, and practicality.\n\nUniversities are also venues for individual freedom and self-expression. Provided that the attire is modest, students should be entitled to dress down outside of academic areas. Most international institutions do precisely this, finding a balance between professionalism and personal comfort.\n\nAllowing shorts outside of formal areas demonstrates faith in students and an indication of a contemporary, progressive campus culture without sacrificing discipline where it is needed most.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT can enhance its participation and success in external events by keeping open entry, i.e anyone who is willing to participate can do so in our events.Doing so will broaden our exposure and also will allow room for the externals to invite us aswell for their events. One more important aspect is, the more events we participate in the more interest the externals will show is aswell."

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community.": "As the Head of Operations for Team Sammard, I have actively contributed to enhancing VIT\u2019s presence in national and international competitions. I played a key role in managing our team's participation in events such as the International Rocket Engineering Competition and the NASA CANSAT Competition, helping us bring recognition to VIT through technical excellence and leadership. We also secured 1st prize at the Sci-Tech Pravega XI Exhibition at IISc Bangalore, further showcasing VIT\u2019s innovation potential. \n\nAlongside these responsibilities, I have also engaged with the academic side of campus life by serving as a Programme Representative for the Mechanical Engineering branch.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively.": "I bring a strong combination of leadership, operational planning, and team coordination skills, developed through my experience as Head of Operations for Team Sammard. I excel at managing large scale student projects, handling timelines under tight deadlines, and ensuring smooth collaboration across interdisciplinary teams. My experience has also strengthened my communication skills, essential for aligning diverse perspectives and driving initiatives forward.\n\nI believe I can contribute most effectively in the area of event execution and strategic planning, ensuring that student-led initiatives are well-organized, impactful, and representative of the vibrant spirit of the VIT community.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One often-overlooked concern among students is the lack of structured platforms for interdisciplinary collaboration outside of clubs and competitions. While VIT encourages innovation, students from different departments often struggle to connect on shared interests unless they\u2019re already part of a formal team or organization.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for creating idea-sharing sessions facilitated by the Student Council, where students from varied backgrounds can meet, exchange ideas, and explore potential collaborations. This would foster a more interconnected student body and unlock new avenues for innovation and community building."

Many times, we find out things at the last minute, which causes stress and confusion. If given the opportunity, I\u2019d make it a priority to bridge that gap by being a reliable point of contact between students and the council.

If I had the chance, I\u2019d push for things like regular student forums or simple suggestion boxes, where everyone can share their ideas or concerns, and make sure those get passed on to the right people.

      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "To expand the Technical Sector and make a greater impact, we should focus on creating a technical mentorship platform where experienced students can guide younger ones through complex projects and skill-building exercises. This would create a culture of knowledge sharing and peer-to-peer learning. Additionally, I\u2019d work on implementing a 'Tech Incubator' space within the clubs a dedicated environment where students can bring their tech ideas to life with resources, team support, and industry connections.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One key issue often overlooked is the struggle faced by slow learners, who may have difficulty keeping up with the pace of the curriculum and the faculty's way of teaching. A practical solution could be peer-assisted learning sessions, where classmates help each other understand difficult concepts willingly. This approach benefits both parties: the student teaching gains a deeper understanding by explaining the material, while the student learning benefits from the explanations in a simpler, relatable way.\nTo ensure the effectiveness of these sessions, it would be helpful to assign a faculty member with a good temperament to monitor the progress and provide guidance when necessary."

Compromised nutrition leads to fatigue and illness affecting studies, while restrictive policies force students (especially women with hostel curfews) to choose between inedible mess food or going hungry during exams. \nPlan of Action:\n1. Student-Led Oversight Committee\n- Form a dedicated Mess Reform Committee (student council members + mess incharges) to: \n\u2022 Conduct weekly hygiene audits with checklists \n\u2022 Implement QR-code-based grievance system (geotagged photo evidence) \n\u2022 Analyze monthly waste/satisfaction data to track progress \n2. Immediate Improvements\n- Diversified Menu: Survey students to add regional dishes (North/South Indian) prepared authentically \n- Staggered Serving Times: Reduce queues via batch-wise meal slots \n3. Transparency Tools \n- Public dashboard showing: \n\u2022 Real-time complaint resolutions \n\u2022 Weekly menu nutrition ratings \n\u2022 Cost vs. quality breakdowns \n4. Immediate Solutions for Food Accessibility \n- Designated Delivery Zones: Set up secure, well-lit food pickup points near each hostel (with CCTV) to eliminate long walks to the main gate. \n- Partner with Swiggy/Zomato for hostel-specific drop locations (e.g., \"Ladies Hostel F Pickup Point\"). \n- Late-Night Food Access:\n- Night mess for all blocks (currently LH A & B don't have night mess facility)\n- Allow approved late-night vendors (verified by admin) to deliver directly to hostel gates until 11 PM.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "1. Improve Awareness & Publicity:\nVIT should proactively promote external events through emails, social media, and campus displays.

Introduce Incentives:\nOffering rewards like cash prizes, certificates, or academic credits will motivate students. Public recognition in newsletters or award ceremonies will further encourage participation. \n3. Strengthen Selection Process:\nA structured screening system\u2014interviews, auditions, or trials\u2014will ensure the best candidates represent the college. Mentorship or training can further prepare selected participants. \n4. Create a Dedicated External Events Team:\nA specialized Student Council team should manage event research, registrations, logistics, and participant support. This ensures organized and consistent participation. \n5. Conduct Post-Event Reviews\nDebrief sessions and performance reports will highlight strengths, challenges, and areas for improvement, helping refine future strategies. \n6. Financial Support System: Travel reimbursement for state level competitions can be provided to encourage participation."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One of the most recurring problems that students inevitably encounter but are usually not given credit for is inadequate communication about academic calendars, events, and deadlines. Most students believe they receive important information late or otherwise informally. If presented with the choice, I would propose a more formal and efficient system of communication, like a unified platform or periodic information updates via formal student organizations. I would collect feedback from students, table the same in front of the relevant authorities, and provide regular follow-ups to usher this change.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "To increase VIT's involvement and success in extracurricular cultural activities, we must prioritize early identification and nurturing of gifted students through workshops and internal competitions. Improved logistical assistance to participants, mentorship through returned alumni, and frequent practice sessions will help increase performance. Also, encouraging a strong cultural community spirit on campus will encourage more students to participate and represent VIT at higher levels."

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community..1": "In my one year at VIT, I had very limited exposure to contribute to the VIT community, but I still managed to make the most out of the opportunities I was presented with. I took on the responsibility of being an IoT mentor at Society of Biological Engineers' BIDFest, an opportunity I greatly enjoyed.\nI was responsible for conducting BIDFest's BIDBuild workshop, a 3 hour workshop wherein we introduced the basics of IoT with Arduino microcontroller board to the participants, to help improve their projects in BIDFest. 200 participants had registered for the workshop, and the majority of attendants recalled having a very fun time learning IoT in the workshop. \nIn addition to the workshop, I also served as the IoT mentor in the actual BIDFest make-a-thon, guiding participants to improve the IoT aspect of their projects.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "My key skills include a blend of organizational efficiency, clear communication and leadership, and strong technical knowledge. I am a very tech-oriented person and so I am experienced with executing tech-heavy initiatives, whereas I have also conducted workshops in VIT and conferences at my school, so I also have experience in planning large-scale events. Within tech, I am not just proficient in AI/ML, but also in UI/UX designing, which helps me design pamphlets, pitch decks, etc. to act as high-quality communication aids.\n\nThe area where I can contribute most effectively is organizing tech-based events, such that I can both deliver the material in those events, and also help in the smooth organization of those events.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "I think one change that students in VIT very much want, but is often overlooked, is the lack of practical learning and lack of emphasis on innovation in all our courses, be it in a theory course, or the lab component of a theory course.\n\nWhile VIT does collect feedback through VTOP and Quality Circle meetings, these mechanisms often lead to surface-level adjustments rather than meaningful curricular improvements. The core issue\u2014lack of hands-on, innovation-driven learning\u2014remains unaddressed, largely because it\u2019s seen as extra work for faculty.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for a more realistic solution: instead of adding new responsibilities, we can ask professors to slightly restructure existing lab sessions. For example, the final experiment of each lab cycle could be replaced with an open-ended mini project based on the concepts already taught. This would encourage creativity without needing new infrastructure or extensive planning.\n\nI would also suggest that professors integrate small case studies or real-world examples into theory lectures\u2014something as simple as explaining how a topic is used in an actual application or industry setting. This doesn't increase workload significantly, but greatly improves engagement and practical understanding.\n\nBy showing how minor shifts within the existing framework can produce better learning outcomes, we can advocate for change that feels doable for professors and meaningful for students.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "Currently, the technical sector of Clubs and Chapters is limited to conducting events in the fests and workshops all year round. Being a part of two major technical chapters, GDSC and IEEE-CS, I can attest first-hand that this, along with the 2 project cycles that each club undertakes, is the full extent of the technical sector of Clubs and Chapters.\n\nI genuinely believe that we can achieve a greater impact in the technical sector by conducting cross-club collaborations, either in the form of shared events/workshops, or shared project cycles. This will not only allow the event to not only have a greater management committee and a larger budget, but will also increase outreach, resource sharing, and interdisciplinary learning. When clubs with different technical focuses\u2014like AI, robotics, cybersecurity, and web development\u2014come together, it creates an environment where diverse skill sets can converge to solve more complex, real-world problems. This helps students develop a more holistic understanding of tech.\n\nAdditionally, the technical sector can expand its impact by integrating with academic departments. For example, clubs can co-host research-driven seminars or mini-project expos in collaboration with professors or labs, encouraging a culture of applied learning and innovation.\n\nFinally, creating a centralized technical calendar and inter-chapter portal can avoid event overlaps, promote joint initiatives, and ensure consistent engagement across the semester.\n\nWith these changes, the technical sector can evolve from being event-centric to becoming a year-round ecosystem for innovation, learning, and collaboration.",

Another change I would like to talk about is the shuttle service to the men's hostel during the night library would help a lot to the students and bring a big change.

Serving as the HR and PR of IIChE VIT (2023-2024) I\u2019ve organized technical events, workshops, and industry sessions aimed at enhancing the professional growth of chemical engineering students. As a board member, I\u2019ve worked to strengthen student involvement and foster collaboration within the department. I was also part of the organizing committee for Technoscape 2023, VIT\u2019s international technical conference, where I handled event planning, speaker coordination, and outreach. Additionally, I am part of the organizing team for SCHEMCON 2025. Beyond organizing, I\u2019ve represented VIT at intercollegiate poster presentation competitions, promoting research and academic exchange.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively.": "My key skills include team leadership, strategic communication, event coordination, and management. I excel at bringing people together to execute well-organized, impactful initiatives\u2014whether through technical events, conferences, or student engagement drives. With experience in both academic and professional event planning, I\u2019ve developed a keen ability to manage logistics, coordinate with industry professionals, and maintain clear communication across teams.\n\nI believe I can contribute most effectively in the areas of student outreach and academic engagement. My background in organizing high-impact events like Technoscape and ChemSummits has equipped me to create platforms that connect students with learning, networking, and professional development opportunities.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One change that students often want but is frequently overlooked is the need for more frequent and accessible industrial visits. While lectures and labs provide theoretical knowledge, many students feel disconnected from how concepts are applied in real-world settings. Industrial visits offer invaluable exposure to plant operations, safety practices, and industry workflows\u2014especially important for engineering students.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for a structured and consistent industrial visit program, collaborating with departments, student chapters, and the Placement and Training Office. By planning visits across different sectors and involving professionals for on-site briefings, we can give students clearer insights into career paths, industrial expectations, and current technologies. I would also work to make these visits more inclusive and accessible to students across all years."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One major issue was during riviera before entering the venue we had to wait outside in a orderly fashion which was not what happened at all. It was a mess with students pushing and pulling and some even fainting due to heat and exhaustion. If I were to manage this specific part of the event I would have made the lines separated using some kind of barrier using coir or metal bars. Although we cannot cover the entire distance atleast doing halfway would make the waiting process a bit less tedious. Also keeping standing fans alternatively at the far ends and center of the lines (think on the basis of width as in left to right) would prevent people from fainting. There were benchs in between but were of no use other than dumping waste on it. Riviera itself was done very nicely but the pre event processes were a bit janky to say.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "Events are usually curcualted via mail or through the screens present in blocks or through friends, roomates, classmates etc. Since a lot of information is send via gmail, keeping a track of which ones are events and which ones are uni related, is hard. In whatsapp creating a channel (official) specially for vit vellore will make 'happening' events more known as almost all of the students have a whatsapp number and so is way more efficient than mails."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One critical area, which is often overlooked is mental health support. Many students are burdened by academic pressure and find the current support system inefficient. After conducting an anonymous survey of the students, if required the college can hire counsellors to help students deal with their issues. Also, (especially first year students) struggle with lack of mentorship while learning something new in any technical field. So it would help them if we could organise peer to peer programs where a student well versed with a particular field will get paired with a student who is a beginner and can guide them.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "I would launch learning sessions and workshops in emerging fields through mentorship from seniors and alumni well versed in that field to help students identify their passion or gain understanding of the field. I would also try to call professionals and startup companies to the campus to conduct tech talks ensuring students gain practical insights. Also, the collaboration of more than one club to conduct an event might increase student participation.",

I made it a point to participate in feedback sessions like QCMs, offer suggestions for improvement if any, and acknowledge the hard work of organizers after attending an event. Informally, I\u2019ve also guided juniors by sharing information about clubs, events, and opportunities on campus. I believe even small acts like these contribute to the overall growth of our community. Additionally, I\u2019ve tried my best to maintain a positive environment by being respectful in college spaces and assisting my fellow peers in academic and co-curricular matters. \n\nWhile I haven\u2019t held any official position yet, I\u2019ve closely observed how events are organized and have always stayed updated on campus initiatives with the hope of one day contributing more directly. I applied for Student Welfare in my 2nd year and recently for Student Placement Coordinator but couldn\u2019t secure the roles. I believe I didn\u2019t showcase my skills or past responsibilities well.

I have served as a member of the student council during my school days, I gained early exposure to taking responsibility, managing tasks, and working collaboratively with other students and teachers. I believe I am analytical and enjoy breaking down complex problems to identify practical, efficient solutions. I approach situations diplomatically, ensuring respectful communication, yet I\u2019m not hesitant to take a firm stand when the situation demands clarity and direction. I also possess strong communication skills, which help me convey ideas effectively and foster collaboration. I have learnt to be calm under pressure and my ability to make thoughtful decisions help me navigate challenges with confidence. I also accept when I am wrong and am willing to learn and adapt into this role. I believe I can contribute most effectively in Student Council as Member Secretary that require the stated skills.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "I truly appreciate all the efforts and systems already in place at VIT that support students both academically and personally. However, one area that often goes overlooked is the lack of clear communication between seniors and juniors. This gap becomes especially noticeable when it comes to understanding systems like the FFCS (Fully Flexible Credit System). While an official document exists, it\u2019s lengthy and overwhelming for most students. A proper FAQ page with simplified answers and a direct reference to the 43-page guide would help. \n\nAdditionally, a student committee under Student Welfare\u2014comprising informed seniors\u2014could be formed to address junior queries accurately, bridging the current communication gap. Often, juniors rely on clubs, chapters, or informal sources for guidance, which may not always provide accurate or complete information. A dedicated platform would help clarify doubts related to course selection and procedural steps, especially for Summer Research. Another issue that needs attention is the uncertainty faced by students staying back for summer research or internships under specific professors. These students don\u2019t qualify for summer semester registration ( since that's only for student's with backlogs ), leading to confusion about whom to contact and what steps to follow regarding room allotment and stay procedures. There\u2019s a clear lack of structured communication in such cases. I would advocate for a centralized, student-friendly system that offers transparent information and direct points of contact to ensure these students are well-informed and supported throughout the process",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "To achieve greater impact, the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters should focus on creating more hands-on, engaging learning experiences rather than just theoretical or surface-level exposure. A lot of students attend events for ODs, but we need to give them reasons to stay for the content.\n\nIf I were to give a suggestion, I think concepts of AI could be meaningfully used to enhance how we host tech events. For instance, we could deploy an NLP-based event assistant chatbot to answer live queries about sessions, speakers, or schedules. It's a relatively easier process where we need a pre-trained model and just need to fine-tune it. This can not make the process easy and but also show the technical prowess of a Club and Chapter.",

Many students use late-night hours for studying, especially during exam periods, and the lack of internet access can be frustrating and unproductive.If given the opportunity, I\u2019d advocate for extending Wi-Fi access during exam weeks and exploring a system where students can request late-night access when needed. I\u2019d also initiate a conversation with administration to find a balanced solution that supports both academic needs and hostel policies.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT can boost success in external events by giving students timely information, better support, and mentorship. A small team to guide and promote these opportunities would help a lot. Recognising participants more often would also encourage more students to get involved."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "The one change that is needed among almost every student is to ''open up their problems''. Students might feel that the person will judge us if we open up. They automatically hesitate to open up their problems and end up in severe depression. I will advocate by creating a ''suggestion box'' in every classrooms, creating safe space by arranging open mic sessions for sharing their feelings in a non-judgemental setting."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One that goes largely unnoticed is the requirement for more flexible and accessible academic and mental health counseling. Students struggle with stress but are reluctant to get help because of stigma or not knowing it's an option. Were I given the chance, I would fight for it by suggesting frequent awareness sessions, anonymous feedback mechanisms, and more prominent, student-accessible counseling services. I'd collaborate with student councils and faculty to make these accessible, confidential, and well-advertised.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "In order to grow the Technical Sector of Chapters and Clubs to make a greater impact, an integrated approach combining team development, student involvement, outreach, and content generation is crucial. It starts with developing a robust, diversified core team that consists of students of various technical disciplines so there is diversity of skills and mindsets. This group can then propel mentorship and peer-learning activities, where seniors mentor juniors in formal sessions on important technical subjects such as Git, Python, AI/ML, or IoT, establishing a robust internal learning culture.\n\nTo further extend learning and teamwork, the club should aim at creating real-world, impactful projects\u2014such as automation software or campus utility applications\u2014that not only strengthen student portfolios but also address concrete issues. Such projects can subsequently be showcased on a special blog site developed and updated by the club. The website would act as a focal point where students have an opportunity to present their projects, publish technical blogs, and post tutorials or experiences, thereby creating ownership and appreciation.\n\nIn addition to this, an ongoing online presence through regular social media engagement can highlight member success stories, tech hacks, and event spotlights, assisting in engaging a wider audience. This online presence can be used to create industry connections with startups and technology firms for project concepts, internships, and guest lectures, introducing valuable outside input and real-world experience to the students. Lastly, operating short-term certification-related bootcamps and workshops in domains such as web development, cloud computing, or cybersecurity would offer organized learning streams while encouraging increased participation. Overall, this comprehensive strategy can considerably enhance the outreach, influence, and longevity of the technical division within clubs and chapters.",

      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "One significant action I would undertake to boost VIT's involvement and performance in outside events is by introducing the 'VIT Touring Ensemble' \u2014 a carefully selected, high-achieving cultural team that represents the university all over India. In contrast to normal involvement, this would be an organized delegation trained throughout the year under expert mentors, having a committed practice schedule, wardrobe assistance, and travel arrangements centrally managed. Imagine it like a cultural athletic team \u2014 performance-driven, professional, and cheerfully representing VIT at top levels of competitions.To fuel this, I\u2019d establish an open digital audition portal open all year, allowing any student to submit performances and be scouted. This ensures fresh talent doesn\u2019t miss the window of opportunity. I\u2019d also collaborate with alumni in creative industries for remote mentoring and sponsorship, creating a self-sustaining, prestigious identity for VIT in the cultural circuit."

This could include anonymous surveys or suggestion boxes that ensure everyone feels safe and heard. By giving students a confidential way to communicate, we can build trust, encourage open dialogue, and create a stronger sense of community where everyone\u2019s voice matters."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One frequently underappreciated issue among students is the unpredictability of the shuttle bus service within VIT. Its erratic schedule frequently results in unnecessary delays and inconvenience, particularly during peak hours. A pragmatic solution would be to implement an intuitive mobile application which enables real-time shuttle location tracking by students. This would facilitate more efficient planning for commute. Moreover, incorporating an addition for booking seats could prevent overcrowding and enhance overall travel experience. The application could also facilitate digital payments, which would facilitate accelerated boarding and alighting, saving time for drivers and students alike. By organizing the shuttle system and making it more convenient, this solution would significantly enhance an important part of college life.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

Many students feel left out or uninformed due to last-minute notifications or unclear guidelines.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for this by:\n\nProposing a centralized digital platform (such as a dedicated app or portal) where all cultural and extracurricular announcements, deadlines, and results are regularly updated and easily accessible.\n\nCoordinating with faculty and student representatives to ensure information is shared well in advance and through multiple channels (emails, social media, notice boards).\n\nCollecting regular feedback from students on communication effectiveness and implementing suggestions for improvement.\n\nBy making communication more transparent and accessible, we can boost participation, reduce confusion, and ensure every student has a fair chance to get involved.",

Since girls are already safely transported from the library to their hostel blocks, the safety of female students during late-night hours would not be a problem. Extending the transport service until 1 or 2 AM would support all students without compromising safety.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "Many students in Biotechnology, Chemistry, and other science degrees take courses like C programming and Python.

This approach would not only enhance learning but also encourage non-technical students to participate in workshops and competitions often held in other colleges, improving overall involvement and success"

But many of their grievances go unnoticed or overlooked. So, in order to increase participation of students, we can make our council active both on- as well as off-campus. Social media could be used effectively to help students with their grievances. The council members could be assigned into groups (each containing members from every domain) to improve the efficacy of solving the issue. The grievances have to be made sure that it's legit and properly conveyed to the people in-charge in order to bring a change. Many students are aware of the student council but still don't actively participate. This is because they are unsure on how to proceed with their grievances. We can also make a personalized portal for grievances and mention all the protocols necessary for each grievance.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

Most of the time, the event timings are given and there's a delay in the commencement which aroused disinterest towards the rest of the events. Be it any event like guest lectures or room counselling or any other events in Riviera or graVITas, students have found that the crowd is immense and the student count is slightly misjudged leading to overcrowding and chaos in event. Proper queue arrangements (increased security personnel to coordinate the crowd) alongwith defined entry and exit times can be announced. Proper seating arrangements with a tentative count on number of students could help in managing the crowd. If given the opportunity, I would make sure that proper crowd management is done and proper instructions regarding the event timings be given alongwith real time announcements on the progress of the events."

I have also participated in external competitions, representing VIT in other universities such as SRM. Apart from this, I have also always strived for excellence in academics, securing 10 GPA in my first semester and being the first rank holder in my branch. I have always suppoted my peers to help them navigate academic challanges to foster a collaborative learning environment.

Having held student council positions for 3 years in school, I\u2019ve gained valuable leadership experience, teamwork abilities, and a clear understanding of student representation.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One issue faced by many students is walking to the academic blocks which are at a significant distance from the hostels. Walking such long distances in the intense heat (which is majority of vellore's weather) can cause various health issues such as dehydration and fatigue. The shuttles are often packed and students are not very keen on paying 40-60 Rs. for travelling inside the campus. Due to this issue, students also prefer not to return to the hostels for lunch and other such meals which causes them to have further health issues and prevents them from concentrating during class. To tackle this, I would advocate having cycle rental system with rates like 5-10Rs per hour, with stands throughout the campus for easy access. This would also reduce pollution while making life easier for the students and preventing them from risking their health.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "The main fundamentals to increase participation is visibility, support and recognision. By organising various intracollege competitions and auditions, it becomes easier to recognise talented individuals and reach out to them. Providing support from the institution will further encourgae paarticipation. Dedicated mentorship for technical events and enough practice time for cultural events will help in increasing the confidence while also improving the chances of success. Allocation of designated practice spaces, provinding some amount of academic flexibility and providing timely reimbursements will boost participation as it takes off a good amount of stress from the students' minds. Broadcasting open calls and team selections effectively will help to spread awareness about such opportunities. Instread of relying on email, positing about it on social media and having posters displayed in academic blocks will increase participation since a lot of students miss out on emails. Also encouraging inter0club collaborations will give a larger exposure to many students and help with information and knowledge exchange to increase success rates. Also, recognising outstanding achievers apart from sports in the university day will also be a great incentive for many students and will encourgae them to perform to their full potential."

Monthly talent shows should be conducted and the participants duely appreciated. Monthly meeting for all Clubs and Chapters must be conducted to hear all the queries and resolve them and ensure that all the CCs are updated about the latest rules implemented. If a new rule is implemented, it must be made sure that every student knows about it. Students must be given a chance to apply for Student Council or other positions based on their experience and not based on their CGPA.

I truly believe I\u2019ve made an impact by staying involved, taking initiative, and most importantly, by connecting with students from all over the country. These interactions have helped me understand diverse perspectives, and I genuinely enjoy being part of that experience.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "Having changed schools almost every year, I\u2019ve grown up surrounded by diverse communities and cultures across India. This unique experience has helped me develop strong communication skills, adaptability, and a deep appreciation for different perspectives. I enjoy engaging with new people, understanding their journeys, and learning from them.\n\nMy curiosity has led me to explore a wide range of interests and hobbies over the years, which has taught me how to connect ideas across domains and approach problems creatively. I naturally take initiative and love stepping into roles where I can learn and contribute meaningfully.\n\nAt VIT, I\u2019ve actively participated in outreach and event initiatives. As part of BNB, I was involved in an official outreach program where we visited a school to spread financial literacy among student, representing VIT and engaging directly with the community. \n\nDuring Yantra, I contributed as a volunteer, helping organize and manage the stock trading event, which involved real-time coordination, participant engagement, and logistical support.\n\nI\u2019ve also developed a strong skill set in UI/UX design through Figma, along with graphic designing. These creative tools allow me to communicate ideas visually and contribute to projects that require both aesthetics and user-focused thinking.\n\nWhile I haven\u2019t held a formal role yet, I\u2019ve consistently made efforts to be involved wherever possible. Now, I\u2019m looking forward to taking on more structured responsibilities and contributing on a larger scale within the VIT community.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One of the major issues I encountered myself. \n\nCultural development is one of the most vibrant yet overlooked aspects of student life at VIT. Despite the abundance of clubs and chapters, only a small segment of students truly gets to experience it. The reason is simple: it\u2019s overwhelming. For a newcomer in a completely new environment, cultural participation often feels like a rushed decision. Events are announced with barely any breathing space, and the gap between hearing about a club and having to commit is so small that many students hesitate, miss out, or disengage entirely. What should be an enriching and exploratory part of college life ends up being intimidating, fast-paced, and inaccessible to many.\n\nThis disconnection becomes especially visible during the first year, which is arguably the most important time for students to explore, experiment, and discover their interests. However, the pressure of navigating through a huge list of clubs and unclear joining processes makes the experience far more stressful than it should be. There\u2019s a missing bridge between curiosity and participation. Students want to get involved, but they also want to do it on their own terms. Without pressure, confusion, or fear of being left behind. The lack of a systematic approach and a warm cultural onboarding makes it harder for genuine talent and interest to surface organically.\n\nTo address this, I propose a three-fold solution:\n\n1. A Centralized Cultural Collaboration Platform: A digital space that brings together all clubs, chapters, and events in one unified interface. Here, students can explore what\u2019s happening around campus, connect with club members, and view upcoming events without the clutter or confusion. This would not only increase transparency but also encourage curiosity and casual participation.\n\n\n2. A Systematic Feedback Mechanism: After events or initiatives, students should be encouraged to provide structured feedback on what they liked and what could be improved. This will help clubs tailor future experiences based on real student input, ensuring that cultural activities are always evolving in a student-centered direction.\n\n\n3. Low-Commitment Discovery Activities: Most importantly, students should be able to discover their interests without the pressure of immediate commitment. By introducing informal, project-based collaboration opportunities or interest-based meetups, students can participate in enjoyable, skill-building activities that help them identify where they truly belong\u2014before choosing to join a club fully. This helps create a comfortable, exploratory phase that aligns with the natural rhythm of student growth.\n\nThis ensures there is proper time for the students to assess their own interests and take joy in pursuing cultural and overall development, while also connecting them to their seniors at college, who they felt once alienated from.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "To enhance its participation and success in external events, VIT must go beyond just offering universal opportunities. While equal access is essential, what matters even more is forming the right teams with the right people. Success in competitions often depends on how well individuals complement each other\u2019s skills, mindsets, and working styles. That is why identifying talent and pairing students who can mutually benefit from each other is crucial.\n\nVIT\u2019s diverse student population is a powerful asset. With people from different academic, cultural, and regional backgrounds, the potential for dynamic and balanced teams is immense. However, to truly harness this, the university needs skilled mentors who can recognize student strengths and guide them into forming teams where everyone plays to their strengths and learns from one another.\n\nA centralized platform for opportunities must be paired with a mentorship network that helps students not just find events, but also find the right people to work with. Whether it's a technical hackathon, a cultural competition, or a business pitch, having a mentor who can help form compatible teams based on complementary abilities can drastically improve outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, VIT can further encourage participation by offering structured incentives\u2014academic credits, certification, logistical support, or internal recognition. These not only reward effort but also encourage students to step forward and make the most of their skills.\n\nBy focusing on both opportunity and strategic team-building, VIT can transform its participation into consistent success, creating a strong culture of excellence and collaboration across all domains.",

I have seen friends who deeply wish to be involved in activities but do not seem to get the oppurtunity to do so.

My curiosity in research has led me to starting a project in the field of proteomics under the guidance of the very talented Dr Immanuel Dhanasingh. I have also contributed to organizing events for clubs like BRSI and have been participating for the last 2 years in leading the flagship event of my school SBST, that is Biosummit.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively.": "I would like to believe i am team player driven by passion and hardwork. I adapt well to the situation at hand and utilize quick thinking to maneuver through it. I recently worked as student organizer for biosummit 2024 which had me realizing my keen interest in leading and facilitating event organization. Over these formative years i have learnt the skills of leadership, teamwork, outside the box thinking, patience and perseverance and would like to apply the same and more to my works in student council for the common good of this university and it's students.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One change that students often desire but that tends to be overlooked is better outreach and communication about campus events.\n\nVIT is a diverse university with a vibrant student population and numerous events happening across departments and clubs. However, many of these events don't reach their full potential due to limited promotion. Students often miss these opportunities catered to them simply because they were unaware or the information got lost in the sea of thousand other notices. \n\nIf given an opportunity I would like to suggest for a student friendly interface or a specialized app that notifies students about the upcoming and ongoing events. This could significantly improve the engagement in events by spreading more awareness."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "I think one improvement that students often look for is more industrial visits outside campus. This would help students gain more knowledge about the course they are taking part in and also give them more of an idea about what to expect further down the line and the opportunities to go for. It would introduce them to new fields and help them understand what to do in the future. I feel that students often complain about how the curriculum is outdated and doesn't provide real world learnings and while VIT does give us the opportunity to go on industrial visits, not everyone in every class/course has that opportunity and could be missing out on learning and discovering something different. I would advocate for it by stating the importance of having real world experience in the student's designated fields, especially in today's world, and that interacting with professionals and their workplace would help give a lot of clarity to students about their future. It would help them make more informed decisions about their time in VIT and after."

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community.": "I have actively contributed to the VIT community through a range of leadership, technical, editorial, and cultural roles that promote innovation, collaboration, and student engagement.\n\nSince 2022, I have been serving as the Programme Representative for my batch-22MIC, acting as the voice of students in discussions covering all aspects of campus life with faculty and DSW. I consistently address concerns, share feedback, and help improve the academic experience through open and timely communication.\n\nAs the Student Head of the Alumni Entrepreneur and Industry Connect team of Institution Innovation Council (IIC), I have been instrumental in conducting multiple events featuring successful alumni entrepreneurs as speakers. These initiatives have contributed in fostering a startup-friendly atmosphere at VIT by offering students first-hand insights into innovation, industry trends, and entrepreneurial journeys.\n\nAs the Editorial Head of IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE), I support the chapter\u2019s efforts to promote women in STEM and engage students in impactful technical discussions through written content. As an active member, I have also lead content creation and on-ground coordination for events like Switchuation and AIGenda during Gravitas\u201924. \n\nAt Riviera\u201925, I served as a Coordinator in the RnR & General Enquiry domain, where I handled speaker systems for campus-wide announcements and managed internal and external registrations. These efforts contributed to clear communication and smooth execution during VIT\u2019s largest cultural and sports event. At Riviera\u201924, I contributed as a Volunteer, helping with crowd management, real-time announcements, and event coordination.\n\nI served as a Zonal Member in the HR domain of the Anti-Drug Club, where I focused on ensuring that different domains met their monthly targets, resolving member-related issues, and supporting HR coordination efforts. This role helped maintain an engaged and goal-oriented volunteer team while promoting a responsible and drug-free campus culture.\n\nAs a Member of Public Relations in the Ladies Hostel Student Committee, I contribute in the management the promotion of hostel events and initiatives through social media platforms, increasing student engagement and awareness. I am responsible for creating and sharing event coverage, raising visibility of committee activities, and fostering a connected and informed hostel community.\n\nIn IC-ETITE\u201924, I was a part of the Outreach team, where I seamlessly coordinated communication with over 5,000 recipients and acted as the Point of Contact (PoC) between domain heads and volunteers\u2014enhancing VIT\u2019s academic outreach and helping foster a globally engaged research environment.\n\nAdditionally, as an Organizer of Fresher\u2019s Meet\u201923, I guided Integrated Program students through event logistics, handled queries, and acted as a point of contact, ensuring that new students felt supported and informed.\n\nThrough all these responsibilities, I\u2019ve aimed to create meaningful, lasting contributions to the VIT community by improving communication, supporting innovation, and fostering a sense of unity and progress among students.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively.": "My key skills include leadership, effective communication, event management, and strategic outreach. I have a strong ability to coordinate teams, manage large-scale events, and foster collaboration across diverse groups. I actively facilitate student-faculty communication, help resolve academic concerns, and strive to make student life on campus more seamless and supportive. Additionally, I excel in editorial work and digital promotion, with experience in content creation, social media outreach, and event coverage. I believe I can contribute most effectively in roles that involve student engagement, mentorship facilitation, organizing innovation-driven events, and creating opportunities that help students grow, connect, and succeed.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One change that students consistently hope for\u2014but is often overlooked\u2014is better planning, timely communication, and financial support around academic and extracurricular activities. Many events are circulated to students at the last minute, leaving them little time to plan, participate, or adjust their schedules. As a result, several students either miss out completely or only come across the communication after the event has passed. Similarly, inconsistency in adhering to syllabus timelines or delays in uploading study materials on VTOP disrupt students' day-to-day academic flow. Another major concern is the financial burden placed on students to initially fund club or chapter events, with reimbursements coming much later\u2014something not always feasible for everyone.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for minimum notice periods for event announcements, regular and transparent academic progress updates, and strict deadlines for study material uploads. I\u2019d also recommend setting up centralized funds for student bodies, so individuals are not forced to pay out of pocket. While I may not be fully aware of the administrative or logistical issues that may have prevented these systems from being implemented so far, I am eager to learn more and work constructively toward long-term, student-friendly solutions."

People are constantly stressed with assignments, tests, and other responsibilities, and sometimes it feels like there\u2019s no space to just breathe or take a break.\n\nIf I had the chance, I\u2019d try to create more awareness around this and suggest small changes-like stress-free days, more chill spaces around school, or even just short breaks during busy weeks. I\u2019d talk to other students to hear their thoughts and bring those ideas to the council. It doesn\u2019t always have to be something big\u2014sometimes even small things can really help."

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community..1": "As a student of B.Tech Computer Science (Blockchain) at VIT Vellore, I have consistently aimed to contribute to the academic environment by maintaining strong academic performance and representing my branch as one of the top performers for both my first and second years. I have actively participated in some of the technical competitions hosted within the college , which has allowed me to engage with peers, exchange ideas, and contribute to VIT's collaborative and innovative spirit.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "I am skilled in programming with languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python. I have a strong foundation in coding and problem-solving, and I\u2019m currently enhancing my knowledge in both frontend and backend web development during my vacation. Additionally, I have started exploring the fields of Machine Learning and Generative AI, which I find incredibly promising and relevant. I believe I can contribute most effectively by supporting technical events, mentoring peers in programming fundamentals, and helping bridge the gap between core technical skills and emerging technologies. I\u2019m also eager to collaborate on projects that integrate AI and development for real-world impact.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "A lot of students, especially those who are just getting started with tech, often feel overwhelmed and unsure about where to begin. There are plenty of resources out there, but what's missing is clear guidance and structured support. If given the opportunity, I\u2019d love to work on building a proper mentorship system\u2014where seniors can help juniors navigate everything from coding basics to building real-world projects. I\u2019d also push for more beginner-friendly workshops and consistent learning paths, so students at all levels feel supported and encouraged to grow.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "I think there\u2019s a lot of potential to make the technical side of clubs and chapters more collaborative and approachable. Often, students are interested but hesitant to join because they think they\u2019re not \u201ctechnical enough\u201d yet. If clubs worked more closely together on common goals, or ran open projects where anyone could contribute regardless of skill level, it would make a big difference. We could also promote more hands-on, project-based learning and improve how events and opportunities are communicated\u2014maybe through a central portal or regular updates\u2014so more students can get involved and stay informed.",

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "VIT has a 372 acres massive campus, but its size can pose commuting challenges for students, especially in areas less served by the existing shuttle services . While shuttle cabs operate during active hours, some regions experience infrequent or delayed services .\n\nTo address this, I propose the implementation of a Personal Electric Mobility Vehicle (PEMV) which I and the team are already working on to electrify the campus and reduce the CO2 emissions. Our solution would include strategic placement and reduced technological friction by making the EVs accessible by tapping ID Cards.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "Technical sectors of clubs and chapters can expand and achieve greater impacts in the following ways:\n\n1) Implement Feedback Mechanisms for Continuous Improvement: Establish systems to gather feedback from club members and event participants. Regular assessments can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that the clubs remain responsive to student needs and interests.\n\n2) Promote Interdisciplinary Projects: Encourage technical clubs to collaborate with non-technical clubs, integrating diverse perspectives into projects. For instance, combining technology with arts or business can lead to innovative solutions and broaden the applicability of technical skills.\n\n3) Implement Project-Based Learning Initiatives: Encourage clubs to adopt project-based learning models, where students work on real-world problems and develop practical solutions. This approach not only enhances technical skills but also solve real world problems.",

      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT can Enhance its participation and success in external events in the following Ways:\n\n1) Conducting National Events: Creating national Level Events would create awareness among other universities and that would create a collaborative and competitive stance of VIT among other universities and hence the students of VIT would be specially invited to other national events.\n\n2) National Event Tab: Creating a separate Event Registration tab in Vtop for National or International events would create awareness about the events as well as easier access for the students to participate and represent VIT.\n\n3) Leverage Alumni & Industry Networks: VIT has a vast alumni network. Connecting students with alumni who've succeeded in such events can provide insider tips, mentorship, and better preparation.\n\n4) Team Creation: Helping students in finding like minded, focused individuals for better team creations and that increases chances of success of the team in the event. This can be done through creating a talent portal or guiding the students through IIC."

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community..1": "During the academic year 2024\u201325, I served as a member secretary of the Student Council, actively contributing to event management for flagship events like Yantra and Primavera. I represented student concerns, including addressing issues such as the discomfort caused by dogs in the ladies\u2019 hostel and the irregular distribution of soft skill questions. \n\nAs a core member of the Documentation Team, I prepared over 10 minutes of meeting and drafted multiple achievement emails. I played a key editorial role in compiling the Student Welfare Annual Report and was the content writer for the official Yantra website. \n\nAdditionally, I contributed to the preparation of the external event calendar and helped sorting the reimbursements for external participation. As an active coordinator of International Women\u2019s Day 2025, I handled both technical and editorial responsibilities.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "Over the past year, I\u2019ve realized that my strongest skills lie in communication, organization, and teamwork. I genuinely enjoy working on documentation and editorial tasks\u2014whether it\u2019s drafting meeting minutes, writing official emails, or creating content for events like Yantra. \n\nWriting with clarity and purpose is something I take pride in, and I\u2019ve always tried to ensure that the message is not just correct but also well-articulated and engaging.At the same time, being part of the Student Council taught me how much I value collaboration. I\u2019ve had the chance to lead and be part of teams during various events, and I\u2019ve learned how to balance responsibilities, handle challenges on the spot, and ensure things run smoothly\u2014from planning to execution. \n\nWhether it was coordinating for IWD\u201925 or representing student concerns, I\u2019ve always tried to approach things with responsibility and empathy.I believe I can contribute most effectively in areas that involve content creation, documentation, and event coordination\u2014spaces where both clear communication and teamwork are key.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One change that students consistently want but is often overlooked is improving basic day-to-day living conditions\u2014things that may seem minor but deeply affect student comfort and well-being.\n\nFor instance, the hard water used in hostels causes hair fall and skin dryness, leading many students to use the drinking water supply just to wash their hair and also spilling the water all the way, increasing chances of slipping and also extra work for the akkas working in each floor. This is not sustainable and points to a basic hygiene issue. I would advocate for the installation of atleast one or two softened water supply taps with improved filtration systems in bathing areas next to the hot water taps in each floor and also work to ensure students are informed about the quality of water and possible remedies.\n\nAnother concern that emerges particularly during the end of the academic year is the sudden spike in prices of cardboard boxes, cello tapes, and markers\u2014items students commonly need while vacating hostels. Shops within the campus often capitalize on this high demand to raise prices, increasing their profits at the students\u2019 expense. This can be addressed by regulating and monitoring prices during vacating seasons, and more importantly, by creating a student feedback portal where students can report unfair pricing with supporting images. A simple mechanism like this could ensure accountability and protect students from unnecessary financial strain.\n\nAdditionally, transportation within Vellore, especially the auto fares between VIT\u2019s main gate and the railway station, continues to be a financial burden. Many students, particularly those traveling during holidays or for internships, face overcharging by auto drivers. A practical and student-friendly solution would be to initiate a prepaid auto system or a unified fare model, possibly in collaboration with the local transport authorities. This would ensure fair pricing and a sense of safety and predictability for students.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "One of the best ways VIT can grow its presence and success in external events is by creating a system that actively supports and motivates students\u2014not just in words, but through action.\n\nFor starters, offering attendance flexibility to students who actually win or secure top positions (like top 5) in competitions would be a great step. It\u2019s a way of saying, \u201cWe value your effort and the name you bring to VIT.\u201d This could push more students to participate seriously without worrying too much about missing classes.\n\nI also believe rewarding winners at the institute level\u2014even something simple like a certificate, cash prize, or a feature on VIT\u2019s social media or newsletters\u2014would mean a lot. A little recognition goes a long way in building motivation.\n\nBut to really improve our success, we need to be more strategic in how we prepare students. Instead of scattered efforts, VIT could form dedicated, handpicked teams for different types of competitions\u2014like hackathons (coding, biotech, agri-tech, etc.), technical and literary quizzes, and MUNs. Once these teams are formed, they should get consistent practice and mentoring. Clubs and chapters already have the resources and expertise\u2014it\u2019s just about connecting the dots and keeping that inner spark alive in participants.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019ve noticed is that many students actually refuse to participate in external competitions altogether simply because they aren\u2019t aware of how the reimbursement process works. There\u2019s a lack of clarity about whether expenses will be covered, how much support they\u2019ll get, or what documents they need to submit. This uncertainty often leads to hesitation, and over time, it turns into fear\u2014especially after hearing stories from others about how \u201ccomplicated\u201d the process can be.\n\nBut honestly, this can be fixed with something as simple as a clear email shared at the beginning of each semester. If students know what to expect and how to go about it, they\u2019ll feel much more confident about representing VIT outside campus without worrying about the financial side of it."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "While VIT has a vibrant ecosystem of clubs and chapters, many students face challenges when trying to actively participate or gain membership in them. Limited intake capacity, lack of awareness about recruitment drives, and unclear selection criteria often result in talented students missing out on valuable learning and networking opportunities.\nBy promoting greater transparency and accessibility in club activities, we can encourage wider student participation and ensure equal opportunities for personal and professional development.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT can do better in external events by training students through workshops and help from experienced alumni. Giving rewards like scholarships or certificates can motivate more participation. Mixing students from different fields helps build strong teams. Providing funds, labs, and good support is also important. Holding small competitions on campus can prepare students for bigger events. Sharing event info early and working with companies can boost chances. After each event, getting feedback helps improve for\u00a0the\u00a0next\u00a0time."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One change that students often wish for\u2014but is frequently overlooked\u2014is the establishment of a reliable and structured online communication channel between students and faculty. I\u2019ve personally experienced, and seen among my peers, how difficult it can be to get timely responses from professors due to overloaded inboxes or conflicting schedules. Faculty cabins and class venues often being in different buildings adds to the challenge, making in-person communication impractical for day-to-day concerns.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for the creation of an official online platform or portal (even a dedicated section in existing platforms like V-TOP or MS Teams) that allows streamlined communication between faculty and students\u2014such as query forms, dedicated message boards, or time-slotted virtual office hours. This would not only reduce the rush to faculty cabins, but also save time and promote transparency and accountability, ensuring that students\u2019 academic and administrative concerns are addressed without unnecessary delay.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "Based on my experience with external events during my previous tenure, I believe VIT can enhance its participation and success by implementing a team grading system tied to regular internal events. Technical events could be held bi-weekly or monthly, while cultural events can be monthly. Continuous grading will encourage consistent effort and improvement, fostering a culture of quality participation. Resource support and reimbursements can be linked to these grades, ensuring efficient allocation of funds without restricting overall participation. Additionally, teams that perform well in external events, even if initially lower graded, should receive upgraded support to motivate growth. To streamline this, I propose creating a robust centralized section in VTOP that manages the entire external event process\u2014from applications, approvals, leave and OD requests, to post-event report submissions and reimbursements. This centralized platform would make the entire process transparent, efficient, and easier for both students and administration."

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community.": "As the Vice Chairperson of IEEE ComSoc, Won the Best IEEE Chapter Award from among 20+ student chapters for 2024-25.\n\nOrganized 30+ successful events each with 200+ participants.\n\nConceptualized and launched \"Hack-a-Tron\", VIT's first hardware-focused hackathon. Solidified\n\nCapture the Flag as a flagship event, attracting 250+ participants and ensuring sustained growth. Secured the chapter's first-ever sponsorship, scaling from an initial INR 5000 to nearly 7\u00d7 growth\n\nWithin my tenure, establishing ComSoc as a trusted and impactful organization.\n\nEstablished and managed the chapter's Medium page, overseeing the publication of insightful articles on emerging communication technologies, addressing key topics often overlooked by mainstream media.\n\nHelped manage expo stall allotment and ensured all events receive the requested material under during my time in Riviera Hall arrangements.\n\nOrganized a Novel Hardware focused Hackathon during Yantra 2023, the only one of its kind at that point.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively.": "My key skill is management and public relations. I forge strong relationships with everyone I meet and strive for mutual success in all endeavours. I can plan and execute events at extreme scales with attendance in the thousands. I can also turnaround teams and get them to achieve targets previously deemed unattainable as was the case with my tenure at IEEE ComSoc. I always have an ear to the ground and that is the foremost pillar of strong execution in my belief.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "Nutrition remains a concern for every VITian. Food served in the dining halls is mostly lacking in nutrition leading to students taking supplements to meet basic nutritional goals. This is in most part due to misaligned incentives for the mess operators. Making food that is rich and whole is not in the best interest of mess operators as this eats into their margins. This leads to sub par food for hostellers as can be corroborated by any hosteller. In messes like the Veg mess, dietary preference of being vegetarian is punished via provision of lower quality food only because veg mess is the cheapest mess.\nI'll advocate for a change in this domain by increasing the stakes for mess operators. I know success in this domain is possible because there are a few messes that have consistently strived to provide quality nutrition to hostellers."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One commonly overlooked area is the lack of external participation among students. Many students are eager to represent VIT at inter-college events, hackathons, and fests, but they often miss out due to a lack of awareness or encouragement. This not only limits their exposure but also the visibility of VIT on larger platforms.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would actively work to increase awareness about external opportunities by initiating regular updates through centralized platforms, social media, and student forums. I would also encourage clubs and chapters to prioritize and promote external participation, providing students with mentorship, support, and guidance to help them participate with confidence. Creating a culture that values and celebrates external representation can go a long way in boosting both student growth and VIT\u2019s presence on the national stage."

These experiences have made me realize how much of a difference even small actions can make. If given the opportunity to serve as a Member Secretary, I\u2019m committed to putting in sincere effort to contribute actively to student life, help bridge gaps between students and administration, and work towards making VIT an even more supportive and vibrant community.",

My ability to clearly communicate ideas has also helped me to work effectively in group settings. I see myself contributing most effectively as a Member Secretary or Member Secretary - Technical\u2014where I can combine my tech skills with my ability to coordinate, present ideas, and engage students. I\u2019m eager to bring creative solutions and strong teamwork to the table to help make university events/activities more streamlined, innovative, and impactful.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "VIT already does a great job in empowering students to achieve their career aspirations through startup incubation and with CDC support for placement prep, and internship opportunities, especially in the final years. But in today\u2019s competitive world, it really helps if students start preparing earlier. A lot of us in the earlier semesters want to build strong portfolios, improve our real-world skills, and get guidance on interviews\u2014but it\u2019s not always easy to connect with seniors who\u2019ve already gone through it. If given the chance, I would advocate for the creation of a structured, peer-led mentorship network where seniors can guide juniors more directly through mock interviews, project feedback, and career tips. It would make a big difference and complement what the university already offers.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "VIT already has a well-structured portal for club events and registrations, and regular alumni and industry engagement adds great value to our ecosystem. But I feel we can still make the technical space more impactful. One idea is to encourage clubs to take up real-world projects\u2014like solving actual problems on campus or around us\u2014which gives students hands-on experience beyond just theory. Another thing I\u2019m excited about is cross-club collaboration. I recently started reading Steve Jobs\u2019 biography, and I was inspired by how he mixed technology with his artistic and creative thinking. I think we could try something similar by getting technical clubs to team up with design or cultural clubs for innovative projects. Also, I\u2019d love to build a shared resource space\u2014something like a common repository where clubs can drop learning materials, project ideas, past event recordings, etc.\u2014so that any student, especially beginners, can explore and learn on their own anytime - even outside club events.",

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

There\u2019s a lack of structured guidance or roadmaps for placements, which leaves students confused and underprepared. If given the opportunity, I would advocate for a student-led initiative under the Student Welfare division to conduct monthly workshops and mentorship sessions.

      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "To elevate the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters, the focus should shift towards building meaningful, real-world projects and fostering inter-branch collaboration. Often, students from non-CS backgrounds have innovative ideas but lack the technical support to execute them and bridging this gap can unlock tremendous potential. Encouraging cross branch teams for hackathons, club events, and project-based initiatives will not only improve learning but also cultivate diverse problem-solving perspectives. Additionally, showcasing high-impact student projects regularly can inspire others and create a culture of hands-on innovation across the VIT community.",

To enhance our participation and success in external events, we need to focus on increasing visibility and creating structured support. Establishing a dedicated External Affairs team within the student body can help identify and coordinate opportunities, collaborate with other colleges, and represent VIT at a broader scale. Additionally, offering flexibility in attendance or academic deadlines(like Additional Learning) for students representing VIT would not only encourage greater involvement but also recognize the valuable learning and exposure these experiences provide beyond the classroom."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

If given a chance, I would investigate the issue properly before coming to a conclusion or support the student if the fault is not theirs and will request for a fair judgement. And another suggestion is that not everyone chooses the course wholeheartedly. So selecting student for council according to their academic performance doesn\u2019t seem fair to me as they everything that the council requires doesn\u2019t need a good cgpa alone. I personally know so many people who are well capable of holding a position in council(leadership qualities, managing skills, photography skills, editing skills, etc), but just because they don\u2019t meet the requirements they aren\u2019t able to contribute to the council. Academics are important, but not all the successful people we know hold a degree or has 7+ cgpa. So I would request to change the current requirements of the student council",

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community..1": "From being elected as CR and climbing through leadership as Vice President and then Student President at school, I carried forward that spirit to VIT, actively involving myself across cultural, technical and social spheres. I\u2019ve represented VIT nationally in MOOD Indigo at IIT Bombay for poetry, being a published poet this has always been my genre! In college I\u2019ve actively been a part of the VIT Anchoring Club, hosting major events. Through the club\u2019s outreach, I was also selected to represent VITAC in a school and had the opportunity to spread knowledge and joy. On the tech side, I\u2019ve contributed as a member of IEEE CS and learnt a lot, alongside being a part of Alpha BioCell where we studied menstrual health, creating awareness and societal impact. I was also selected to be a part of Rivera\u2019s Proshows team, getting the opportunity to handle FOH on the very first day! Having a strong academic presence rooting from my parents who are scientist from ISRO and director at Deloitte I strive to serve perfection with passion, as I stand at the end of my second year I hold 3 internships, of which I was one among the 3 students shortlisted at CFM, VIT Vellore as a research intern on Neuromorphic Computing and as my third internship is ongoing I proudly present that I\u2019ve been selected as an intern at IISc Bengaluru. Along academics I also hold a great sense of empathy and compassion to give back to my society hence am working on a project that adds to the healthcare industry. Helped organise events like DJ nights in the hostel committee and hosted major events. A major highlight would be my fluency in 5 languages that enables me to connect and communicate to various people. My journey has always been rooted in showing up, learning and giving back with intent.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "I bring together empathy, clarity and commitment. My strongest abilities lie in leading with purpose, communicating with authenticity and managing people and tasks with structure and spontaneity. Whether it\u2019s organizing, representing or anchoring, I thrive in dynamic environments. My blend of creativity from years in poetry and cultural events and precision from my academic and technical pursuits allows me to bridge diverse spaces. I believe I can most effectively contribute in enhancing engagement, promoting inclusivity, and executing ideas that carry both impact and identity.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "Some everyday concerns that genuinely affect student life often remain under-addressed. Firstly, there is a lack of consistency in food services across hostels, each building is assigned a different caterer, resulting in varied dining experiences. Standardizing catering under a single, well-reviewed provider could greatly enhance student satisfaction and health. Secondly, with the campus continually expanding, shuttle services should be made complimentary and scaled to match student volume, this would ease daily commute stress. Third, 24/7 Wi-Fi access is no longer a luxury but a necessity for academics and communication. If given the opportunity, I would advocate through organized student feedback, data-backed proposals, and clear communication with administration because sometimes, the smallest improvements can create the biggest shifts in student well-being.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "As the member secretary-cultural, I believe we at VIT have the best mix of students who are talented in various genre but don\u2019t come out and express themselves due to several reasons, like lesser opportunities, fear of judgement or mere laziness! To counterbalance these the first step would be awareness, awareness of what are the events students can take part in, the first thing we would target would be have a team for external event management, wherein every quarter we have a hunt and search for various events around the country, further as the information has been gathered it needs to reach students, we can have mini expos for pitching external events and attract students to participate with the prizes and as an addition provide an external event participation certificate from VIT too. This would encourage students to participate, not forgetting to also educate them on how representation in a different forum would build their confidence and credibility! (Also mentioning the fun in travelling to different places). Further we need to provide guidance, having an experience of talking on stages of institutions like IIT Bombay I would\u2019ve been better prepared if I had someone over my head to guide and take my practice or help me prepare. We can have small committees of senior students who have already been to external events who can guide the new students. This way fear of performance and lack of preparation would not be a concern. All in all building a team for external events management will make it more structured and easy to go about."

With experience managing technical conclaves, cultural events, and student initiatives, I excel at organizing large-scale activities while balancing stakeholder expectations. I can contribute most effectively in planning and executing institute-level fests, driving student engagement, and fostering communication between clubs, councils, and the administration.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "Many students express interest in electives that align with emerging technologies but these are either limited in availabilitynot offered at all. Introducing such electives can enhance the curriculum by making it more industry-relevant and future-ready. If given the opportunity, I would gather student feedback through surveys, identify high-demand electives, and work with academic departments to propose their inclusion."

I serve as the Events Head for the tenure of 2025-2026 where I plan, organize and conduct activities for everyone.. I\u2019m also a senior core member in ACM, an international technical chapter, where I work in the design team. Over the past year, I\u2019ve been involved in planning and organizing major technical events. Two of the biggest ones were Cryptic Hunt during Gravitas and Reverse Coding during Yantra, both of which saw thousands of participants.\nApart from technical events, I was also part of the Events Team for Riviera, VIT\u2019s cultural fest, where I helped manage multiple events and made sure everything ran smoothly. These experiences have helped me contribute to both the technical and cultural side of VIT\u2019s student community.",

As the Events Head in IET and a senior core in ACM, I\u2019ve managed events like Cryptic Hunt and Reverse Coding, which had huge participation. These experiences taught me how to lead teams, stay organized, and handle pressure.\nI also work in ACM\u2019s design team, which helped me grow creatively. I was part of the events team in Riviera too, which gave me experience in handling cultural events. I feel I can contribute best in areas where planning, creativity, and teamwork come together.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One change that a lot of students want but that often gets overlooked is more access to practical, industry-level knowledge as part of our academic journey. While classroom learning is important, many of us feel underprepared when it\u2019s time to step into the real world. There\u2019s often a gap between what we learn in theory and what\u2019s actually expected in the workplace.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I\u2019d really push to bridge that gap. That could mean organizing hands-on workshops, bringing in industry experts for regular sessions, creating more opportunities for real-world projects, and working closely with alumni who are already out there in different fields. I\u2019d also advocate for stronger internship support, access to certification programs, and exposure to the tools and software that are actually used in the industry.\n\nTo make this effective, I\u2019d start by gathering feedback from students what industries they\u2019re aiming for, what skills they feel they\u2019re missing and work with faculty and the placement cell to bring in relevant opportunities. At the end of the day, it\u2019s about making sure we\u2019re not just earning a degree, but actually gaining the skills and confidence to use it in the real world.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "I think the technical sector of clubs and chapters can grow a lot if we focus more on doing complete project cycles. When students actually build projects from scratch, they get to learn everything\u2014frontend, backend, design, deploying the project, and even using tools like GitHub, which is really important in the industry. It\u2019s a great way to learn practically. We should also make websites for events and enrollments , so that juniors find it more interesting and professional. It makes things easier and also helps in attracting more participation.\nApart from that, hosting online competitions and encouraging students to take part in competitions in other colleges can help us reach more people and bring new ideas. These things can really expand the impact of technical clubs in VIT.",

      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "To really boost VIT\u2019s participation and success in external cultural events, I think we need to focus more on building a strong and supportive environment for talented students. This means regular practice sessions, early identification of performers, and having proper mentorship to guide them. Many students have the talent but don\u2019t get enough exposure or the right platform so if we can help with travel support, better rehearsal spaces, and more visibility into upcoming competitions, it\u2019ll make a big difference. Also, encouraging collaboration across clubs and learning from alumni who\u2019ve done well before can really help us shine on\u00a0bigger\u00a0stages.",

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One common yet often overlooked improvement students seek is more practical, hands-on learning experiences and better opportunities for networking with the right people in tech. While theory is emphasized, students often struggle to apply what they\u2019ve learned and lack exposure to real-world industry connections.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for this by:\n\nProposing industry-led workshops, tech talks, and interactive sessions to bridge the gap between theory and practice.\n\nOrganizing networking-focused events, such as panel discussions, alumni meetups, and mentorship programs, where students can connect with professionals, founders, and recruiters.\n\nCollaborating with faculty and student bodies to integrate mini-projects and live case studies into the curriculum.\n\nCreating peer-led initiatives, like skill-sharing bootcamps or team-based challenges, to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange.\n\nThis would not only enhance students\u2019 technical skills but also open doors for internships, mentorship, and career guidance.",
      "Select the domains in which you are skilled.": "Web Development (Frontend), Machine Learning",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "In my opinion, the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters can achieve greater impact by focusing on three key areas: collaboration, accessibility, and relevance.\n\n1. Collaboration Across Clubs: Encourage inter-club collaboration for larger events like tech fests, hackathons, and innovation challenges. This fosters a stronger tech community and allows pooling of diverse resources and talent.\n\n2. Accessibility for All Skill Levels: Often, beginners feel intimidated or excluded. Creating tiered workshops\u2014from beginner to advanced\u2014along with mentorship programs can ensure everyone, regardless of experience, can participate and grow.\n\n3. Industry Relevance: Hosting events with real-world relevance\u2014like sessions on current tech trends, open-source contributions, and startup culture\u2014can better prepare students for careers in tech. Inviting alumni and industry professionals can also help bridge the gap between campus and career.\n\n4. More Networking Opportunities: Regular meetups, tech mixers, and panels can help students build meaningful connections with peers, mentors, and professionals.\n\nBy making the technical sector more inclusive, collaborative, and future-focused, we can create a vibrant, impactful tech culture on campus"

Here\u2019s a slightly more detailed version, still in simple language:\n\n\u2e3b\n\nOne small but common issue students face is not having a proper space for group discussions, especially for projects and presentations. Since talking isn\u2019t allowed in the library, it becomes hard to find a place to work together quietly. This is a problem during project deadlines when teamwork is important.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would suggest setting up group study zones or discussion rooms on campus. These spaces can have whiteboards, charging points and enough seating. I would also collect feedback from students and share it with the college to show why such spaces are needed. This will help students work better without disturbing others.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "I believe that if we want to enhance our performance in external fests, we should first prepare a calendar listing which includes all the fests of the particular academic year and circulate it so that students who are actually interested can apply. We can then hold auditions and also train them with the help of seniors who have experience or are good in that area. This can be a mentorship program to help students improve existing skills or learn new skills. Giving them proper practice spaces, flexible timings so that their academics aren\u2019t affected, good travel and accommodation support will also help them prepare better and stay motivated."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

The courts in the paid indoor badminton facilities at MH, outdated gym equipment with no trainer, no dedicated facility for cricket or football and if there is at some extent then they lack good quality sports equipment and qualified trainers for VIT's team to train and excel in inter-college tournaments. \n\nAs far as our own vellore campus is concerned, one solution would be to consider, understand and observe how VIT Chennai or even in some cases SRM Chennai is doing good in inter-college sports tournaments by just simply having qualified trainers and better equipment/infrastructure. This will help students of our campus get access to the best-of-the-class facilities, thus improving their performance and increase VIT's participation and domination in external events.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "The technical sector of clubs and chapters can achieve greater impact by fostering collaboration, organizing hands-on events, and building strong industry connections. By making activities more inclusive and relevant to current trends, and by encouraging participation from a diverse group of students, clubs can create a dynamic environment that enhances learning and innovation. This approach not only develops technical skills but also prepares students for real-world challenges, ultimately strengthening the university\u2019s overall academic and professional community.",
      "Select the domains in which you are skilled.": "Web Development (Frontend), Machine Learning",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT can boost its participation and success in external events by creating a supportive environment that encourages students to take part in competitions and conferences. This can be achieved by providing dedicated mentorship, financial assistance, and flexible academic schedules(for eg. attendance flexibility, reCATs) for participants, ensuring they have the resources and time needed to prepare effectively.\n\nAdditionally, building strong connections with industry experts and alumni can offer valuable guidance and networking opportunities. By recognizing and celebrating student achievements in external events, VIT can further motivate students to represent the university and excel on larger platforms.",

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "Students often face inconvenience while ordering food from services like Swiggy and Zomato as they have to collect their orders from main gate. Instead, if delivery agents are allowed to come up to hostel gates it would be much more convenient, especially for students whose hostels are far from main gate.\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for allowing the food delivery services to deliver the orders near hostel gates. To address security concerns, the delivery agents\u2019 ID cards can be submitted at the security office upon entry and returned when they exit the campus. This would ensure both convenience for students and safety within the campus.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "All students should be made aware of upcoming events so that no talented student misses a good opportunity to represent VIT in external platforms. Providing financial and logistical support for travel and registration fees can further encourage participation. Organizing mentorship and preparation workshops will help students feel more confident and prepared. Additionally, forming a dedicated student committee to track, share, and promote external events can significantly enhance the participation and success in external events."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One important change that many students at VIT want but is often overlooked is stronger support for women and minority groups in technical fields and campus clubs. Many students from underrepresented backgrounds feel hesitant or intimidated to join domains like tech, public speaking, or leadership roles due to a lack of inclusive environments. If given the opportunity, I would advocate for creating safe-space sessions and beginner-friendly environments that encourage participation from all students. Organizing women-led panels, workshops, and mentorship programs in technical and leadership areas would also help build confidence and representation. Additionally, collaborating closely with Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) groups and clubs focused on inclusivity would ensure that these efforts are meaningful and sustained, helping to create a more welcoming and supportive campus culture at VIT."

As Editorial Head and Board Member of CSI-VIT, I\u2019ve demonstrated leadership, content strategy planning, team coordination, and a consistent commitment to the growth of the community.\n\nMy leadership journey, however, began long before college. At The Heritage School, I served as House Captain, Assistant Prefect, Vice Captain of Dronacharya, and finally, got elected for the role of Deputy School Captain. These roles shaped my ability to lead with empathy, listen actively, and work inclusively with peers. Winning the Sudakshina Laha Memorial Award for the Best All-Round Student in 2015 further reinforced my dedication to discipline, service, and excellence.\n\nI believe I can contribute most effectively by bridging communication across teams, ensuring collaboration, and representing student voices with integrity and empathy. My ability to lead with empathy, listen with intent, and communicate with confidence positions me as someone who can bring out the best in individuals and teams\u2014driving not just performance, but also a sense of belonging within the VIT community.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One change that students often want but is frequently overlooked is more accessible and transparent communication between student bodies and administrative departments. Many students have valuable suggestions or face genuine concerns, but they either don\u2019t know where to voice them or feel unheard when they do.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for the creation of a centralized, student-driven feedback and suggestion portal, where students can anonymously or openly share ideas, issues, and improvements. I would ensure this feedback is regularly reviewed, categorized, and addressed in monthly council meetings, with clear follow-up actions communicated back to the student body. In addition, I\u2019d propose open forums or listening hours with student leaders, where students feel comfortable expressing themselves in a supportive environment.\n\nBy building a stronger communication loop, we can create a more responsive, inclusive, and progressive VIT community where every student feels heard and valued."

At GraVITas, VIT's annual tech fest, I served as a Student Volunteer and later as a Student Coordinator in 2024. I was part of the Halls and Arrangements Committee under the Student Welfare team, where I developed key skills in time management and team collaboration. Similarly, at Riviera, I worked twice as student volunteer These experiences strengthened my communication and management capabilities, and gave me hands-on exposure to large scale event planning.\n\nIn addition to these, I contributed briefly as a Core Committee Member in roboVITics, the official robotics club of VIT, focusing on web development tasks.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively.": "Over the course of my time at VIT, I have developed a strong set of interpersonal and organizational skills, particularly through my role as a committee member during our college fests.

I believe these skills are directly aligned with the responsibilities of a student council member, especially when it comes to planning and executing student-led initiatives.\n\nAdditionally, I have cultivated strong communication skills, both verbal and written. Drafting clear and professional emails, preparing formal communication, and conveying ideas effectively are areas where I can contribute meaningfully. These are essential aspects of student council work, where maintaining smooth and efficient communication with various stakeholders is crucial.\n\nLastly, one of the most valuable lessons I've learned at VIT is the ability to remain calm and solution-oriented in the face of unexpected challenges. Organizing events in a large and dynamic environment inevitably comes with unforeseen issues, and I\u2019ve learned that patience, adaptability, and critical thinking are key to resolving them efficiently. I believe this problem-solving mindset, combined with my collaborative nature, would allow me to be a dependable and resourceful member of the student council.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "Personally i feel mostly the things have been looked at by the management but i feel like there can be a better is to create a blog section where initially seniors can post the solution to the problem they faced also the seniors can share some tricks and good insight in the same platform that could be a part of the vtop as a sub section.\n\nPersonally i would advocate by writing blogs myself along with urging my peers to do the same. Once this will be done the blogspot will become a self growing section that would help both juniors and sometimes seniors too."

I\u2019ve ideated & helped host workshops. I even volunteered in purchase domain during Gravitas and Riviera fests.\nMy participation extends to various competitions like 1st prize in a Gravitas 2023 hackathon, Best Fresher at Yantra 2024 hack, 2nd in Neo Codethon by CDC, AIR 35 in Ninja Slayground by Coding Ninjas etc. Read more at https://www.linkedin.com/in/bharatwalejain\nCurrently, I\u2019m serving as Vice Chair & Tech Head of the IET Chapter, where I work closely on planning and executing technical events. Through these diverse experiences, I\u2019ve developed strong leadership, coordination and collaborative skills while consistently striving to uplift the technical culture at VIT.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "My core strengths include frontend development, programming in Python, C++ and Java, UI/UX design and team management.

I\u2019ve also contributed to inter-club collaborations, been involved in bringing speakers for events, and taken charge of on-ground event management.\nWhether it's setting up event registration platforms, designing user-friendly interfaces, coordinating between tech and design teams or managing technical logistics during fests, I\u2019ve worked across various layers of execution. I believe I can contribute most effectively by facilitating smoother collaboration between technical clubs and chapters, streamlining the tech execution of events and enhancing accessibility to technical opportunities for the wider student community.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "While VIT has a centralized portal, what\u2019s often missing is cross-club collaboration and a dedicated student-led technical community, especially for domains like competitive programming, open-source and real-time problem-solving. Many students want regular coding circles, team-based contests and guided session beyond isolated club events.\nIf given the opportunity, I\u2019d advocate for forming a student-driven technical teams that organizes inter-club events, weekly coding meetups and collaborative hackathons. I\u2019d work with existing clubs to align calendars, share resources and build a more consistent tech ecosystem.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "VIT\u2019s technical culture has great potential, but its impact can be amplified through better coordination and long-term collaboration. Instead of functioning in isolation, clubs can come together to form domain-specific student communities such as coding circles, design guilds or open-source groups that run regularly and are open to all.\nIntroducing a shared technical calendar, organizing joint initiatives and forming a student led technical council can help align efforts across clubs. If given the opportunity, I would work towards creating a more connected and consistent technical environment, where knowledge-sharing and collaboration lead to deeper, long-lasting impact beyond individual events.",

I believe the role of the student council goes far beyond just organizing events-although that is important. We are here to represent the student body, to be the voice for those who come to VIT with the same passion and zeal that we have, and to ensure their concerns are heard.\nI feel that university life could be greatly improved if students were able to communicate their issues more effectively to the management. Bridging this communication gap and reinforcing the belief that the student council genuinely supports and represents them can make a significant difference in their experience. I am committed to working towards building that trust and making sure every student feels empowered and heard."

I would then work with the student council and administration to propose a plan for improving facilities, organizing regular inter-department tournaments, and introducing more opportunities for students to participate in both competitive and recreational sports.",

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

Many students feel pressure from the CGPA and begin to think whatever their CGPA is, is how they are valued, which they are not.\n\n\nGiven the chance, I would advocate for a more supportive environment through open discussions, peer mentoring and awareness sessions to remind students that their growth, skills and effort are more important than a grade. I would work with faculty and student bodies to ensure the student that is struggling feels sentient, guided and motivated to keep pushing rather then give up.",

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "To get more external participants at VIT events, I think we need to improve how we promote them. A lot of people hear about our events late or not at all. Sharing info early through Instagram, LinkedIn, and reaching out to other colleges directly can help. Also, making the registration process simple and making sure participants have a good on-campus experience will leave a good impression and bring more people in the future."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked?

Seats fill up super fast, there are long lines, and it sometimes creates unnecessary competition because there are just too many students trying to use the same space.

      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "I feel like the technical side of clubs and chapters at VIT has so much potential, but sometimes it feels like only a small group of students are really involved. A lot of others are interested but might feel intimidated or think they\u2019re not 'techy' enough to join. I believe we can change that by making things more beginner friendly like having casual intro sessions, hands-on workshops, or even simple peer-led help groups. If seniors and experienced members guide others without making it feel competitive, more students will feel comfortable joining in. The goal should be to build a space where learning, experimenting, and even failing is okay because that\u2019s how real innovation starts.",
      "Select the domains in which you are skilled.": "Web Development (Frontend)",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT has no shortage of talent what we need is a stronger bridge between that talent and the opportunities outside. I believe we can boost our presence in external events by creating a central student led platform that regularly shares event updates, forms interest based groups, and connects students with mentors who\u2019ve already won or participated before. Imagine a space where juniors learn from seniors, where practice sessions are supported, and where students feel backed by the college, not just individually competing. If we build a culture that celebrates preparation as much as participation, VIT won\u2019t just show up at events we\u2019ll lead them.\n\nWould you like to personalize this based on your department or interests (like hackathons, debates, fests, etc.)?",

But beyond the technical, one of my most valued strengths is my ability to understand people \u2014 to listen, empathize, and consider every angle before making a decision.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "I would share my experience here. What we as students need is more practical, hands-on learning opportunities integrated into the curriculum, not just theory-heavy lectures or last-minute labs. Many students, like me and my friends want space to experiment, build, and fail safely without it affecting grades. We crave real understanding, not just marks.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I\u2019d advocate for open lab hours, student-led workshops, and micro-project spaces where we can collaborate across branches. I\u2019d collect feedback directly from students, take it to the right faculty or clubs, and help create a structure where learning is active. We need to bridge the gap between what's taught and what sticks \u2014 and I\u2019m ready to help build that bridge.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "Speaking as a fresher, one thing I noticed early on is that a lot of students \u2014 including seniors \u2014 genuinely want to learn, but they don\u2019t always know where to start, or they feel like they\u2019ve missed the boat. The technical sector can have a much bigger impact if we make it more welcoming and beginner-friendly. Many clubs focus on advanced topics or intense competitions, which can be discouraging for someone just starting out. Surely tho, we should have advance level events for advance learners. \nOn top of that, the selection processes are often way too intense, especially for first-years who are still figuring things out. It\u2019s overwhelming, and some students give up before they even get the chance to try.\n\nIf we focus more on learning-first environments: open workshops, hands-on mini-projects, collaborative events without the pressure of titles or ranks, we'd have a greater impact.

      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "Honestly, I think VIT can step up its game if students participate for the love of it, not just because it looks good on paper. When we do things purely for trophies or resume points, the passion fizzles out fast. Instead, if we can instill a mindset of having fun and learning from the experience \u2014 from the heart \u2014 then participation will naturally increase, and success will follow. \n\nAt the same time, we should embrace the real culture of India\u2014the one beyond surface differences like clothes or labels. It\u2019s about shared values: respect, unity, resilience, and a willingness to learn together. If we instill this thought process, where collaboration and humility matter more than winning alone, VIT\u2019s spirit will grow stronger.",

I also enjoy digital art, where my creativity truly comes alive. For me, the passion behind photography and editing sparks only when I feel a personal connection to the memory \u2014 that\u2019s when art stops being just a skill and becomes a feeling.",

Through e-mails and social media students should be given information about how certain activities can help them grow and network. I've seen many talented individuals opting out of various opportunities just because of lack of information and their hesitation in asking any query. Google forms attached with anonymous questionnaire can be used to solve any query."

This role has allowed me to assist my peers in navigating academic challenges, clarifying doubts, and accessing necessary resources, thereby helping to create a more supportive learning environment. In addition to academic support, I have organized and been part of several conferences and events that have served as platforms for knowledge annd information exchange and skill development.

I\u2019ve organized events as part of the chapter and in my respective department, which has helped me understand how to handle logistics and inspire people to give their best.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?": "One thing I\u2019ve noticed, and I\u2019m sure a lot of students agree, is that there aren\u2019t enough good spots on campus where we can just sit together, talk, and work on projects comfortably. During busy times, finding a place to collaborate feels like a real struggle. People end up sitting on stairs or in random corners because there\u2019s just no proper space to gather, brainstorm, or study as a group. If I get the chance to be part of the student council, I\u2019d push for creating more student-friendly collaboration zones, places with enough seating, plugs for our devices, and maybe whiteboards to jot down ideas. We don\u2019t need big changes, just smart use of the spaces we already have. I\u2019d also talk to students from different departments to find out where the biggest needs are and take those suggestions to the right people on campus. Having spaces like these would make working together easier and less stressful for everyone."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One thing I\u2019ve noticed is that a lot of students go through stress or anxiety, especially around exams, but don\u2019t really talk about it. It\u2019s not because they don\u2019t want to\u2014it\u2019s more because they\u2019re scared of being judged or feel like no one will really understand. I think this is something that often gets overlooked. If I get the chance, I\u2019d love to help create a more open space where students feel safe to share what they\u2019re going through. Maybe through casual peer-support circles, wellness sessions, or even just making people more aware that there\u2019s help available. Sometimes, just knowing someone is listening can make a big difference.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "Honestly, when I first looked at the technical clubs and chapters, I felt a bit intimidated. It sometimes feels like you already have to know everything to even be part of it, which can push people away\u2014especially those who are just starting out or still figuring things out. I think the technical sector could really grow by becoming more beginner-friendly and less intimidating. Maybe through casual workshops, beginner bootcamps, or even peer-led sessions where asking basic questions doesn\u2019t feel awkward. I also feel like there\u2019s so much potential if technical clubs worked more with non-technical ones\u2014like combining tech with social causes or creative projects. That way, more students can see how their skills matter and feel encouraged to jump in, even if they\u2019re not confident yet.",

I\u2019ve noticed that sometimes really talented people don\u2019t join these events because they either don\u2019t know about them or feel like they won\u2019t get enough support. I think we could do better by sharing info about these opportunities more regularly, making practice spaces easier to access, and offering some mentorship or feedback sessions to help teams prepare. Also, just recognizing and appreciating their efforts on campus, whether they win or not, could encourage more students to step up and proudly represent VIT. Sometimes, a little support and encouragement is all it takes for someone to really shine."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One key improvement that students often seek but is frequently overlooked is enhanced mental health support. Although academic excellence is a primary focus, the mental well-being of students is equally important and deserves greater attention. The demand for accessible, effective mental health resources\u2014such as counseling services, stress management programs, and peer support networks\u2014is rising, yet these services are often underfunded or underutilized due to stigma or lack of awareness.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for this by initiating collaborations with mental health professionals and campus organizations to expand the availability of support services. This would include advocating for increased visibility of mental health resources, the implementation of stress-relief programs during high-pressure periods, and the introduction of workshops that promote emotional resilience. Additionally, I would propose establishing a digital platform for students to anonymously seek advice or book counseling sessions, ensuring accessibility and privacy.\n\nBy fostering an open, supportive environment, I believe we can prioritize the holistic development of students, allowing them to thrive academically and personally.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "To expand the impact of the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters, I believe the focus should be on increasing inter-club collaboration through joint projects, hackathons, and coding competitions, which will encourage students from various technical domains to work together and innovate.\n\nOrganizing hands-on workshops in emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, and IoT will also allow students to apply their skills in practical settings. These workshops could be complemented by industry interactions, enabling students to gain real-world experience.\n\nFinally, leveraging digital platforms for workshops, tech challenges, and webinars will ensure greater reach and engagement, fostering continuous learning and participation across the campus.\n\nBy enhancing collaboration, providing practical learning opportunities, and utilizing digital tools, the Technical Sector can become a dynamic space for innovation and skill development.",

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community..1": "I've joined clubs and I'm committed to contributing meaningfully through participation, collaboration and volunteering. I am willing to organize events, support initiatives, and make a positive environment around the campus that helps the VIT community to grow stronger and be more connected. Joining the Student Council will give me the platform and reach needed to implement this initiative effectively and make a larger impact in the VIT community.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "I consider leadership, teamwork, communication, and creative problem-solving as my foremost capabilities. I have performed on stage for six years and have led my school\u2019s drama club, thus my strengths lie not only in public speaking but also in the area of event organization. My course of computer science suggests that I am also well-versed in the technical aspects of it. Therefore, I think that my most significant contribution will be in the places requiring collaboration, representation, and event management, in addition, I can contribute to the organization of activities that are both stimulating and inclusive of the VIT community.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "There are a number of drawbacks that the students are longing to work out, like delivery pick-up point being far away, lack of proper field for cricket/football, and not enough transport options inside campus. All these are of marginal importance, but from my point of view, the worst neglected one is still a student to student communication problem. \nNowadays club registration openings or interview schedules are mostly distributed by email or Instagram. The thing is that emails are usually ignored due to cluttered inboxes, and Instagram isn\u2019t an official tool or a platform for communication that all students use. \nIf I were chosen as Member Secretary \u2013 Technical, I would advocate this problem by initiating the development of a platform or an application where all the new club notifications, deadlines, and opportunities would be outlined and be easily accessible. This would ensure that everyone would be more likely to participate, and help build a more connected student community.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "To bring the Clubs and Chapters Technical Section to a wider audience and achieve greater impact, I suggest that we concentrate on three main points: accessibility, collaboration, and visibility.\nFirstly, a lot of the students are keen on technology but they are not willing to join clubs because of the lack of clear guidance or the unawareness of what each club offers. The creation of a centralized digital platform with all the details and information about clubs, upcoming events, and available roles would unquestionably facilitate students\u2019 involvement greatly.\nSecondly, through events such as hackathons, joint, and mentorship programs, the clubs can participate in collaborative activities. It becomes easy for clubs to join forces and market their services to more students. Such cross-club collaborations also create a more cohesive and energetic tech community.\nLastly, the technical projects that happen are usually small in terms of number. Instead, by publicizing these activities through well-designed exhibitions, contests, and multi-disciplinary events with participation of non-tech students as well, the technical sector can have a much broader and more sustainable visibility and appreciation on campus.\nThe technical sector at VIT can be more inclusive, impactful, and future-driven with the right alignment and student-centered activities.",

      "Briefly describe your contributions to the VIT community..1": "In my time at VIT, I have actively contributed to the campus community by participating in organising events for college initiatives like Engineers Day, Innovation Week, Gravitas, Riviera. For example, I have been part of ASME-VIT and Toastmasters International, where I helped coordinate. Additionally, I\u2019ve volunteered in outreach programs and collaborated with peers to make impact. These experiences have not only strengthened my leadership and teamwork skills but also fueled my passion for creating a positive and inclusive environment at VIT. I believe these contributions, combined with my enthusiasm, make me well-suited to serve as a member of the Student Council.",
      "Describe your key skills and specify the area where you believe you can contribute most effectively..1": "My key strengths are leadership and delegation. I excel at setting clear goals, motivating teams, and fostering a collaborative environment. By identifying individual strengths, I delegate tasks effectively, ensuring productivity and accountability. This approach empowers team members while maintaining high performance. I contribute most effectively in roles that require strategic planning, team coordination, and project execution, where strong leadership and smart delegation drive successful outcomes.",
      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "Many students want stronger mental health support and less academic pressure, but this need is often overlooked. Schools focus on grades over well-being, and existing services can feel inadequate. To advocate, gather student stories and data, form a coalition, and propose solutions like flexible deadlines or more accessible counseling. Meet with administrators and use campaigns to reduce stigma and raise awareness. Student-led efforts can lead to lasting, meaningful change. Counsellers are available yes, but the environment is such that the amount of academic competition is far too high. For instance even hostel counselling is done based on academic performance. There could be some changes there",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT can enhance its participation and success in external events by fostering a stronger culture of mentorship, early talent identification, and interdepartmental collaboration. Providing dedicated training programs, increased funding, and access to industry mentors can significantly boost preparation. Encouraging cross-disciplinary teams and recognizing achievers can build motivation. Regular internal competitions and workshops will also sharpen skills and readiness, ensuring that students are better equipped to excel in external platforms. Most of which is already being implemented to some effect, the full potential is yet to reach the right audience"

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One overlooked improvement is providing easier access to lab equipment and workspace for student projects outside academic hours.

I would advocate by initiating a proposal through clubs and chapters, gathering support via a student petition, and presenting it to the administration with a structured plan to manage access responsibly.",
      "In your opinion, how can the Technical Sector of Clubs and Chapters be expanded to achieve greater impact?": "The Technical Sector can be expanded by organizing more interdisciplinary hackathons and hands-on bootcamps that integrate mechanical, electronics, and coding principles. Collaborations with startups and industry mentors could also provide real-world exposure. Creating a shared resource bank with tutorials and tools would enable students to explore new domains independently and confidently.",

      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "To enhance VIT's participation and success in external cultural events, I would focus on three key areas: talent identification, structured preparation, and strategic exposure. Firstly, we can conduct regular internal competitions and auditions to identify promising talent across various cultural domains. Secondly, by forming dedicated training groups with expert mentorship and allocating rehearsal slots, we can elevate performance standards. Lastly, building strong collaborations with clubs, increasing awareness of national-level cultural fests, and arranging logistical and financial support for travel will encourage wider participation.

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "A major problem faced by students is the exorbitant amount of money taken by auto drivers to take them out of campus, even though the prices are regulated by VIT. To solve this issue, either we can centralise the booking process for autos through a website or app controlled by the administration or we can enforce stricter checks at main gate for ensuring the fair price is taken from students.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "To increase the chances of participation and success in external events, it's important to bring it up as a culture among students. The main thing that would stop students is the ambiguity regarding the official procedures to participate in such events- most of them are not sure about it and do not know what all incentives VIT provides. So one thing we could do is, run a marketing campaign to participate in external events by incentivising travel or other benefits given, thereby getting students to participate. At the same time we should circulate memos about events, fests to students. This will students to have a better understanding and start discussing among themselves. This over time, will make it a culture in VIT.",

It is often reported that certain caterers do not follow the guidelines set out in the VIT mess for proper hygiene and nutrition.\n\nIf I had a chance, I would encourage the use of a clear and encompassing feedback process that includes students. For this approach, we would conduct a survey each month and create a forum where students can mention problems and rate their dining experience. My suggestion to the Students\u2019 Council is to partner with the administration and Mess Monitoring Committee to inspect the school cafeteria regularly and hold caterers accountable. Notably, I would suggest making a scorecard for every mess, scoring them on quality and hygiene, and updating it monthly to help caterers compete and do better as a unit. I aim to give students the education they expect and deserve."

The auto fares are extremely inconsistent and prices are hiked for non native students. I have talked with many students both seniors and freshers and this seems to be a very common issue but frequently ignored.\n\nAs VIT students are the main customers for the autos I believe that the fares need to be regulated. For that a standard can be set for eg: a per km rate. \n\nI would go through the necessary channels and pitch this idea with the concerned authority. Firstly I would prepare a proposal including all the necessary details and call to action and submit it to the concerned personnel through the student council"

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One change that students often want but is frequently overlooked is a more balanced academic and extracurricular environment. Many students feel that the current exam schedule, with multiple exams spread throughout the semester, sometimes emphasizes on memorisation rather than truly assessing understanding and critical thinking. This can lead to unnecessary stress and limits the scope for deeper learning.\nAdditionally, students often desire improved sports facilities and more flexibility in hostel timings, as these factors play a significant role in maintaining a healthy balance between studies and physical activity.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "VIT can enhance its participation and success in external events by actively promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. Encouraging students from different fields\u2014such as arts, technology, design, and communication\u2014to work together can lead to unique and creative presentations that stand out at competitions. For instance, combining cultural performances with digital effects or integrating storytelling with technology can offer fresh and impactful experiences.\n\nTo implement this, VIT could organize regular cross-club meetups and brainstorming sessions to foster connections between students of diverse backgrounds. Facilitating collaborative workshops and joint projects will help students learn from each other and develop versatile skill sets.\n\nMoreover, cultivating a culture that values learning through experimentation and constructive feedback is crucial. Providing safe spaces for rehearsals, open critiques, and iterative improvements before competitions will allow students to refine their work without fear of failure. This approach encourages innovation and builds resilience, ultimately leading to stronger performances and higher chances of success in external events."

      "What is one change or improvement that students want but is often overlooked? If given the opportunity, how would you advocate for it?.1": "One major issue often overlooked is the heavy academic load combined with inconsistent teaching quality, especially in core coding subjects. Many students struggle not just with the volume of assignments and exams, but also with ineffective classroom delivery, where concepts are rushed or not explained clearly. This often forces students to rely entirely on self-study or external resources.\n\nIf given the opportunity, I would advocate for improving the standard of academic delivery by collecting honest student feedback and encouraging faculty development initiatives to enhance teaching methods. I would also work toward better coordination of deadlines and more structured academic calendars to reduce student burnout. The aim is to ensure that every student, regardless of background, receives quality instruction and has the support needed to thrive.",
      "In your opinion, how can VIT enhance its participation and success in external events?": "Firstly, talented students should be identified and encouraged early through internal competitions, workshops, and mentorship programs. \nSecondly, dedicated training and mentoring for teams participating in hackathons, MUNs, cultural fests, and technical conferences can boost confidence and performance. Alumni and faculty with relevant experience could be involved in guiding these teams.\nLastly, VIT should provide financial support for travel, registrations, and materials, along with academic flexibility like attendance leniency or deadline extensions which is often absent for participants. Publicly recognizing achievements would also motivate wider participation."

I would collect data through surveys, hold open forums for student input, and present a detailed proposal to faculty and administration showing how this flexibility can actually enhance student productivity, engagement, and overall growth.
